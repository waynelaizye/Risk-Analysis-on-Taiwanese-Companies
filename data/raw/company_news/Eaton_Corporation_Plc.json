        "\n      \n    Why Eaton Corporation Stock Fell 10% in December ": "Returns as of 5/1/2020Returns as of 5/1/2020Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.The shares of globally diversified industrial giant Eaton Corporation (NYSE:ETN) fell 10.8% in December, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. This result, however, includes a slight rebound: The stock was down as much as 15% at one point during the month. Even so, the weak end to 2018 capped a somewhat difficult year for Eaton, as it closed out the 12-month span down 13.1%. And from its October highs, the stock declined an even more worrying 22.4%.Check out the latest Eaton earnings call transcript.Eaton's stock price rose just over 50% between January 2016 and December 2017, so a pullback in 2018 shouldn't be all that surprising. Even adding 2018 to the mix, to make a three-year span, the stock was still up nearly 32%. That, for reference, easily beat the S&P 500 index, which was up about 23% over the same period. So it's tough to get too upset about Eaton's December 2018 stock performance or the full-year result.Image source: Getty Images.The late-year pullback was related largely to worries about the health of the economy. As an industrial company, Eaton tends to be sensitive to the economic cycle. When times are good it prospers; when times aren't so good, its financial performance drops off. That's simply par for the course. And the last few months of 2018 witnessed increasing concerns about economic growth domestically and abroad. Investors reacted by selling Eaton stock.Driving those concerns were things like global trade tensions, slowing economic growth in China, and worries that the Federal Reserve's continued interest rate hikes would depress U.S. growth. These fears are unlikely to end soon, suggesting that Eaton's stock will continue to be volatile for a while.Eaton's December performance isn't a reason to head for the hills. It remains a well-run company with a highly diversified business backed by a solid balance sheet. In fact, with the yield at 3.8%, income investors might want to put the stock on their watch lists. This could be a good entry point for a company with a long history of rewarding investors with regular dividend hikes. Note, too, that Eaton continues to adjust to the world around it, and in 2018 it introduced a new division focused on electric vehicles. This is not a company that thinks in months; it thinks in decades. Most investors should take a similar approach.Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

For the conference, all the participant lines are in a listen-only mode. There will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)I'll turn the call now to Mr. Don Bullock, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning. For those of you I'm Don Bullock, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you to all of you for joining us for Eaton's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon our Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer.The agenda for today's call includes our opening remarks by Craig highlighting the performance in the fourth quarter, our outlook and our guidance for 2019. As we've done on our prior calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments today. Before we dive into that I do want to make a couple of quick passing comments. The press release for our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we'll go through have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that the press release and the presentation include reconciliations to any non-GAAP measures and a webcast of the call will be accessible on our website and available for replay after today's call.Before we get started, I do need to remind you that the comments today do include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Any results that might differ materially from our forecast that could be due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and those are described in the earnings release and the presentation and they will be also outlined in our related 10-Q filing.With that, I'll turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay. Thanks, Don. I'll start on Page 3, with highlights of our Q4 results and I'll start by saying that I'm very pleased naturally with our reports this morning and another very strong quarter performance, which really rounded out a solid year overall. Earnings per share of $1.46 a share, up 13% from last year and above the midpoint of our guidance. And this was driven by both strong growth in sales as well as higher margins.Sales were actually $5.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 5% and this includes 7% organic growth, and this was above our guidance of 6% for the quarter. Bookings growth in the quarter was also strong led by double-digit growth in both Electrical Systems and Services and in Aerospace.And so we continue to be pleased with our margin performance as well, which increased a 100 basis points to 17.4%. We had solid margin performance really across all of the segments, and all-time record margins in Electrical Systems and Services and in Aerospace.We also generated very strong operating cash flows of $1.1 billion, up 27% and a quarterly record, if you exclude the $300 million arbitration payment that we made earlier this year.And lastly, we reported and repurchased $700 million of shares in the quarter, taking advantage of what we saw as a significant pullback in financial markets. And if you'll recall, we had planned to purchase $200 million to $400 million in the quarter to achieve our target of $800 million to $1 billion for the year. I'd say for now you can think about this as an acceleration of purchases and that we were planning to make in 2019. However, if markets remain weak, we'll certainly take advantage of those opportunities as well and buy at higher levels.Moving to Page 4, you will see our financial summary for the quarter. You can read these numbers for sure, but I'll provide maybe just a bit of context here. First, our operating segment profits increased 11% and we generated strong incrementals of almost 40%. Second, segment margins of 17.4%, were at the high end of our guidance range and 100 basis points above Q4 2017. And finally, our net income as reported was flat with prior year and prior year included income related to the US tax bill. Excluding this one-time benefit from Q3 -- Q4 '17, our net income increased 10%.On Page 5, we'll start our segment overviews with Electrical Products. Revenues grew 3% in Q4. This includes 5% of organic growth, offset by 2% in currency. And it was really a strong finish to the year and it was actually our highest organic growth rate for electrical products since Q4 of 2014.As we expected, growth in our Lighting business turned positive and was up mid-single digits, while orders increased 3% and this was led by solid growth in the Americas. I'd also note here that our backlog increased 15%. And while we generally think about this as a book-and-bill business, this increase does suggest that we didn't see any unusual pre-buying at the end of the quarter. Segment margins were 18.2%, flat with prior year, and this was largely a result of some unfavorable product mix between the business.Next, we can move to Page 6, and a summary of our Electrical Systems and Services segment. As I noted in my opening commentary, this segment posted excellent results for the quarter. The business continued to strengthen, we posted 10% organic growth in the quarter with strength across all major end markets. The 10% growth represented an acceleration of growth, which was above our Q3 growth rate of 9% and above the Q2 growth rate, which was up 7%. And as you can see, we did have some negative impact from foreign exchange and a small divestiture during the course of last year.Orders were even stronger, up 12% on strong growth in all major end markets in the Americas and in EMEA. And I'd say that this strong growth in Q4 was against a very strong comp from last year, when orders were up 12%. You'll recall from our Q3 earnings call that we noted a pause in orders during the month of September. We had expected that this was largely project timing and temporary, so things really played out as we expected in this segment.In addition, our backlog continued to increase and was up 13%. So overall, the segment is performing very consistent with what we would expect from this long-cycle business. And lastly, segment operating profits were up 19% and we generated all-time record margins in this segment of 16.6%. So a very strong quarter across the board.If you turn to Page 7, we'll summarize the results of our Hydraulics business. Here we had another strong quarter of revenue growth with sales up 6%, 8% organic growth, offset by 2% negative currency, and we continue to see strength really in mobile and with industrial OEMs, in construction and ag markets and in the distribution channel, so pretty broad based.Orders were down 4%, and I would say here on tough comps. And if you recall Q4 2017, our orders were up 25%. In the quarter, we did however see continued strength in Asia with orders up 10%, orders in the Americas were flat, but at very high levels, and we continue to see order weakness in EMEA with orders down some 24%, as lead times continue to improve. And I'd also add here, but this was the region where we had our most difficult comp, orders in Q4 2017 were actually up 38%. And so we feel once again pretty good overall about the activity levels in the Hydraulics business.Our backlog does remain strong. It increased 6% from last year. And turning to Operating profits, we increased profit by 15% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 13%. So I think the right conclusion here is that we made solid progress in this business, which was held back in some prior quarters by some supply chain issues, but that progress need to continue and is expected to continue going into 2019.On Page 8, we move to Aerospace, and the business here is clearly firing on all cylinders. Now begin by noting that growth continued to accelerate in Q4 with organic revenue growth up 13% and this is up from 9% growth in Q3 and 6% growth in Q2. Orders also accelerated, increasing 17% with strength in commercial transport, military fighters, and both commercial and military aftermarket. And our backlog continue to grow, up some 13% in the quarter.The business here also demonstrated very strong operating leverage with profits increasing 30% and delivering record operating margins of 22.9%. I would add that the favorable mix certainly contributed to these record margins as aftermarket revenues continued to perform well, but our team also is doing an outstanding job of executing.Moving to the Vehicle segment on Page 9. We're also very pleased with how this segment performed in the quarter. Our revenues were down 2% with flat organic revenues and 2% negative FX. The NAFTA Class 8 truck market remained very strong in the quarter and reached 324,000 units for 2018, and this is up some 27%. Yes, you'll recall here that revenues for our automated truck transmission business are now included in the Eaton Cummins joint venture and are not consolidated in our financials.The JV actually had revenue growth of 45% in the quarter. So our business overall is performing extremely well. On the other hand, our global light vehicle production was down in Q4 with North America up modestly, offset by slight declines in Europe and particular weakness as you've all heard in China. Despite flat organic revenues, operating profits increased 4% and our operating margins increased 90 basis points to 17.9%.And finishing up our segment summaries, eMobility is on Page 10. Organic revenue growth was 11%, offset by 1% negative currency. Not unexpected, operating margins declined to 11.3% as we continue to ramp up our R&D spending. You'll recall that this new segment was created in Q1 of last year. At last year at the Investors meeting, we told you that eMobility will become a new $2 billion to $4 billion segment of our company. And I'm pleased to say that we're on track. 2018 was a busy year, and a year where we ended ahead of schedule.We are in ongoing discussions with a large number of customers on new programs and we remain very optimistic about the long-term growth outlook for the business, overall. We're ahead of schedule on new product developments, these new products are allowing us to quote on a broader range of opportunities and quite frankly to move from selling only components to selling systems. So we remain very excited about the future of this segment and the work that our team is doing and what this represents as a growth opportunity for Eaton as we move forward.And before we turn our attention to 2019, I would like to just take a moment to recap some of the key highlights from 2018 now, which we see a strong year -- as a strong year progress. First, end markets improved allowing us to generate 6% organic revenue growth, and this was double the growth rate of 2017 and above our initial estimate for the year, which was 4%. We continue to make good progress on enhancing our margin performance with a 100 basis point improvement, and setting an all-time record for the company at 16.8%.As a result, our net income per share of $5.39, when you exclude the $0.48 impact from the legacy Cooper arbitration decision was up 16% over 2017. And our teams very effectively offset both the impact of tariffs and commodity inflation with incremental price. We generated $3 billion of operating cash flow, and this would exclude to $300 million impact from the arbitration payment. This allowed us to return $2.45 billion to shareholders, $1.15 billion in dividends and another $1.3 billion of share repurchases. And the $1.3 billion represents 4% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.So overall, very proud of the team. We exceeded our financial commitment toshareholders. We invested in the future of the business and really are building a stronger company.Now turning to 2019. Let me begin by summarizing our growth outlook. Overall, we are expecting 4% to 5% organic growth, and this is consistent with the outlook that we provided in Q3 2018 during our conference call. As we take a look at our individual businesses, we expect 4% to 5% organic growth in Electrical Products, with continued strength in industrial and large commercial projects. We expect modest growth in Lighting and also modest growth in single phase power quality and small commercial projects.For Electrical Systems and Services, we see 5% to 6% organic growth. And here our backlog is very strong, we expect continued market strength and power distribution assemblies in the Americas and in the data center markets globally. We also see modest growth in both the utility and harsh and hazardous markets.For Hydraulics, growth is expected to be 5% to 6% on (inaudible) levels that are already very strong, but we see continued strength in mobile markets in Asia and in North America. And Aerospace markets really are universally strong and we expect to see 8% to 9% growth on strength in OEM and aftermarket and really with both military and commercial customers.Vehicle markets are expected to be flat for both North America heavy-duty truck and for global light vehicles, but both are running at, I'd say, very high levels, and we expect to see strong growth in the Brazilian truck market.Overall, our organic revenues are expected to be down 2% to 1% for the year. But once again, keep in mind that our revenues for automated truck transmissions are expected to grow and are now a part and reported as a part of the Eaton Cummins joint venture. Finally, we expect eMobility to grow 11% to 12% organically, consistent with the level of growth that we experienced in 2018. And while we're still a few years away from what we call a major growth inflection point, our optimism for this segment continues to grow as we look forward.Moving on to Page 13. We lay out our margin expectations for 2019. For Eaton overall, we except segment margins to be between 17% and 17.4%. At the midpoint, this represents a 40 basis point improvement over 2018 and it really places us solidly within the 17% to 18% range that we set as a 2020 goal and I would add, one year ahead of schedule.And with the exception of eMobility, we are investing – we were investing heavily in product development. Margins are expected to increase in each of our segments, specifically, Electrical Products at 18.6% to 19.2%, a 50 basis point improvement and Electrical Systems and Services at 15.2% to 15.8%, up 60 basis points; Hydraulics at 14% to 14.6%, up 90 basis points; Aerospace at a very strong level already but at 21.4% to 22%, up 70 basis points and Vehicle at 17.4% to 18%, up 20 basis points. eMobility as we noted, we're investing heavily in this segment; margins will be down to 6.1% to 6.7% from 70 basis point, really just as a function of heavy R&D investment.And on Page 14, we pick up the balance of our guidance for 2019, so we expect our full year EPS to be $5.70 to $6 a share. At the midpoint, this represents a 9% increase, excluding the impact of the arbitration decision that reduced 2018 earnings by some $0.48. As we discussed, organic revenue is expected to be up 4% to 5%, but this growth is expected to be partially offset by some $250 million of negative currency translation.We expect our corporate costs, including pension and interest and other corporate items to be flat with 2018 and our tax rate to be between 14% and 16%. This will result in operating cash flows coming in between $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion and we expect CapEx to be $600 million.As I noted, we accelerated some $400 million of share repurchases into Q4. So the target purchases for 2019 are now at $400 million. And for Q1, we expect EPS to be between $1.18 and $1.28, a 12% increase at the midpoint. And for Q1, we also expect organic growth to be approximately 4% to have segment margins between 15.5% and 15.9%, and a tax rate of between 13% and 14%.So overall, we expect another strong year. And actually, Don, this concludes my opening comments and I'll hand it back to you and you can open the lines for Q&A.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks, Craig. Before we -- before I hand it to the operator to open it up for questions. I do want to make a couple of comments. First, we do acknowledge today is the day that has a enormous number of peers out there on earnings announcement. So we are going to hold our call to an hour. To do that, it's important that you limit your questions, to a question and a follow-up, if you would so we can be sure to cover everyone's questions.With that, I'll turn it over to the operator to give instructions.OperatorThank you. (Operator Instructions).Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur first question today comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystThank you, good morning. Very solid, Craig, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of additional color on how you saw things play out during the quarter. Obviously, the quarter itself was very strong, but we did have that peculiar slowdown in September. Did you see people tapping the brakes in December as the market got wobbly and, and what are you seeing here in January?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, Jeff, I guess you're referencing largely what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call in Electrical Systems and Service, where we did see this pause during the month of September. We had indicated at the time that we thought that was a temporary pause that, these projects do -- at sometimes tend to be lumpy, and we thought that would come back in Q4 which it certainly did.Now, I'd say, Q4 was really pretty much a consistent quarter. We saw high level of economic activity really across the quarter, pretty consistent across each of our businesses, and as I had noted, with no real significant, no measurable pre-buy at all as evidenced by the growth in our backlog. And so I think it was a solid clean quarter across the board and, and despite the level of economic uncertainty that's out there, activity levels are fairly good. And in through the month of January, we've really seen kind of a continuation of that performance -- certainly in the context of our guidance for Q1, which is a little lighter than the growth rate that we saw in Q4. We do think there is some economic uncertainty out there, which is essentially what we have reflected in our guidance. But by and large, activity levels across our businesses are still quite positive and quite strong.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystThanks. And unrelated, just on tax, Rick. I mean, your guidance is pretty straight forward, but we've seen a couple of companies getting hit by this IRS change and deductibility of interest. Is that an issue for you or a wildcard or is that fully encapsulated in your guide?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerIt's fully baked into our guide, one of the reasons that the tax rate jumps from roughly around 13% to 15% in 2019 is, because we're reflecting the implications of all these regulations that came out last year, some of which I think surprise some companies, but we had anticipated that they would come out largely as they did. So that's why we're comfortable with this 14% to 16% range for '19.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystGreat. Thank you.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThanks, good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystSo Craig, maybe just on the EPS range, $0.30 wide versus kind of like typical is closer to $0.20. Maybe can you just give us some insight into why you expanded the range and what market conditions have to be in place to drive you to that -- towards the higher end or the lower end of the range?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I would suggest, Jeo, that don't really over read or read much into the fact that the range is a little bit wider. I mean, I think it's -- as our EPS in absolute dollar terms increases, the percentage and the range will naturally widen a little bit, but I'd say that, for us, the big variables as we look forward into 2019 that could potentially influence whether you're on the low-end or the high end of the range is largely a function of what happens with our end markets.Right now, I said, we're feeling fairly good. It was a strong fourth quarter coming in stronger than what most had expected ourselves included. And so I think it's really a function of how end markets perform going into 2019 and to what extent some of the geopolitical kind of concerns that we're dealing with in various kind of countries around the world get resolved. But I wouldn't read anything into the fact that the range has been opened up a little bit, you know it's -- we're feeling very good about kind of the Company's performance overall and degrees of freedom that we have around things that we can do in the event of a little bit of economic slowdown. So I would not over read that at all.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay. That's good to hear. And I guess my follow-on. You guys cited power distribution assemblies and data centers as strong growers in '19. I think data centers were up high-single digits. This is though a little at odds with some of the announcements we've heard from some of the chipmakers. So, maybe talk a little bit about like the strength that you're seeing in data centers that makes you feel good about the prospects for '19?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean the data center market, I'd say, if you look at the long-term trend of what we've been seeing in general as the whole world generates and consumes more and more data, I think is pretty compelling for the long-term growth prospects. We saw strong double-digit growth in 2018 as well as a lot of major projects being announced. And so as we think about data centers in general while on the hyper scale side of the market it can be somewhat lumpy, we do think that what we're looking at, in the form of an existing backlog and projects that are in the pipeline that the numbers that we're talking about for 2019 which is kind of mid single-digit growth are very much in line with what we have visibility to.I think the chip maker piece is perhaps one that's a little bit more nuance in terms of whether or not that’s a direct proxy for what we are seeing specifically in the data center markets, as a lot of the big data center companies are actually in many cases vertically integrating and doing a lot of this work themselves as opposed to relying upon third parties. But now we feel very good about the data center market and about how we're positioned and about the number of projects that have already been announced. And so we think it's going to be another strong year.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGreat. Thanks, Craig.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from the Nicole DeBlase at Deutsche Bank.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerGood morning, Nicole.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystSo, I guess, maybe starting with the 1Q outlook. It seems to me like the step down to 4% organic growth could be a little bit of conservatism, reading between the lines, is what you said in response to Jeff's question. But I guess maybe thinking about from a segment by segment perspective, where is the step down coming from?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say that as we take a look at Q1, we're certainly seeing a step down in the growth rate, I’d say, principally in Electrical Systems and Services is one of the big drivers. In the Hydraulics, I'd say, would be another one and then also in Aerospace. And so those would be the three big ones that I'd say there is a relative step down in the growth rate. And I think, you know, largely the way we think about it, Nicole, is the way I answered the question earlier that there is a lot of economic uncertainty out there whether it's Brexit or just funding the US government or trade disputes with China. And so we think given the level of uncertainty that’s still out there in Q1 that you could largely see a little bit of a pause in economic activity until some of these major structural issues are resolved. And that's kind of what's baked into our forecast. Could it be conservative? It could be, but given kind of just a level of economic uncertainty out there, we think it's prudent to plan for these issues to at least extend through Q1 and be resolved at some point and we think all of that logic is baked into our guidance for the year of growing some 4% to 5%.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, understood. Thanks, Craig. And I guess, maybe my second one just around Hydraulics. So, one of your big distributors talked about Fluid Power demand stepping down a bit in the last two weeks of December. Curious about that, as well as the confidence in the outlook for China Mobile to remain strong just because I think CAT is looking for more like kind of a flattish equipment environment in China in 2019?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerChina has continued to -- maybe, I'll deal with that one first before I get to the distributor one. China has continued to perform extremely well. If you take a look at excavator sales in Q4 and reloader sales, excavator sales are up more than 20% in Q4, reloader sales up more than 10%. And so the China construction equipment market, at least in terms of looking at the public data continues to perform extremely well and our business does as well. And so we think as we look into 2019, we do think that growth rates moderate, but we still think that we see growth in the China mobile market, specifically going into 2019, and that's kind of consistent with what we're hearing from many of our customers.And quite frankly, Eaton in the region we've done extremely well in terms of new wins and gaining some market share on platforms and that also influences our thinking as well. But in terms of the distribution market, I can't really speak to one distributor in one part of the region. But I would say that our Hydraulics business in Q4, we had growth of -- organic growth of 8% and that growth was pretty even throughout the quarter and so we felt very good about the growth rates and we did not see, generally speaking, or here generally speaking of any slowdown that took place at the end of the year. It wouldn't surprise me that if there is a distributor in some place who sold a slowdown some place, but more broadly speaking, our business continued to perform well.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystUnderstood. Thanks, Craig.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystYeah. Hi, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystMaybe -- Craig, maybe you could dig a little bit deeper into some of your end markets and give us some color in terms of where you're seeing the strength and looking particularly maybe Electrical Products, which specific industrial markets, which sub segment of commercial projects and then likewise maybe power distribution. Just so we get some color as to what's going on out there?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, and I'd say that in the beginning with Electrical Products. One of the things we noted, Ann, was that – of our Lighting business returned to growth. It's been a business that obviously we were taking some strategic steps to work through some specific market segment issues and so that business for us returned to growth in Q4 and we think the outlook for Lighting -- going into 2019, as that business will continue to grow low-to-mid single digits.We think that the single phase power quality business, another business that grew mid-single digits in Q4,we had order growth that was a little better than that actually in Q4 and so that market continues to do well. And then largely the power distribution components, a lot of what we sell in the components side goes into small and large commercial projects in general. And so when you think about some of the growth that we see today in our Electrical Systems and Services businesses, mainly the -- most of the components that support that business come through our Electrical Products business. Some of that goes through distribution as aftermarkets as well and so that business continues to do well. So -- so we saw, generally speaking, pretty decent growth, as I mentioned, the strongest growth that we've seen since 2014 in Electrical Products and the orders are performing solidly. And so, we think that market continues to have a decent year in 2019.In Electrical Systems and Services, I mean it’s really, as I mentioned, almost strength across the board. Large industrial projects, commercial projects, those markets continue to perform extremely well and you see many of the same data streams that we see non-res construction, numbers continue to be up strongly mid-to-high single digits. The Dodge non-res contracts on -- were up 23% in dollars in Q4 and on a square footage basis up 10%. And so we're really seeing strength in most of the non-res construction markets. And as we talked about in data centers, hyperscale and data centers in general, had very strong results, up strong double digits in 2018 and we think a little bit of moderation in that growth rate as we move into 2019, but still strong growth. And so we think in general these businesses continue to perform very well and that no real evidence of any economic slowdown at this point. And so we're feeling very good about 2019.And then, Crouse-Hinds (inaudible) oil and gas is another one of those segments that's been a lot of stuff talked about, but we had very good growth in Q4 in our Crouse-Hinds business, up strong single digits, high single-digits. And so that business as well, despite a little bit of pullback in oil and gas prices at the end of the year, we saw some recovery in December. And so we think that market also continues to grow going into 2019.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystOkay, that's good color, I appreciate that. And then just to follow-up on the sustainability of Aerospace margins. I mean we know it's great to have high margins in Aerospace, but we also know we have to be investing in the future. So can you just talk, Craig, maybe about the near-term maybe positive mix versus the longer term, you need to be on the next platform in order to sustain those high margins?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAbsolutely, and appreciate the question. You know I think there's two things that are really driving the high margins in Aerospace. I think, one, it is the fact that after market is continuing to perform extremely well. And as you know, Ann, better than most, I mean, at the end of the day you make most of your money in Aerospace and aftermarket and aftermarket is performing extremely well, both in commercial and in, on the military side.The other thing that I'd say that we and others are getting a real benefit from right now is really what you alluded to, Ann, is the fact that we are in a bit of a pause period as an industry in terms of new programs. We went through a massive refresh over the last 10 years and most of these new programs are actually going into service at this point in time. And the next -- by time you get to the next generation, the next refresh, you're probably 5 to 10 years out. And so I do think that our Aerospace margins will continue to be at very high levels for the next number of years and until we get to the point where we have the next round of major investments required for the next generation of commercial and/or military aircraft. And so we are investing in the future. We're doing a lot of investments in offline technology development to be ready for insertion to get to a technology readiness level that says that we are ready to participate on the new platforms. But I'd say it's really those two things that are really benefiting our business as long as -- as well as very strong execution by our operational teams.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystRight. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThe next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks guys, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSo, what a different three-months makes. I’m just trying to understand the turnaround in ESS because it feels like there's probably more economic uncertainty in the US than it was back in September and October. So, I'm wondering what are you hearing from the field, your sales engineers, customers, whatever in terms of what caused the pause and why the release now? And maybe just in terms of commenting on pre-buy activity this quarter, pull ahead of price increase, et cetera. Did you see any of that and could you explain some of these fluster?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say, Nigel -- I appreciate the question and we spent a fair amount of time talking about it on the Q3 earnings call. And I think the way we characterized it at the time was we said, the business -- we thought it was in fine shape and we said, we saw a specific pause in the month of September and the business tends to be lumpy anyway. And we try to encourage everyone of the look through September and say everything is going to be fine, which is the way it turned out, and so I wish, I could give you the exact answer to why we saw this pause in the month of September, other than saying that sometimes it does happen in these big systems businesses where orders tend to be lumpy, but by and large, I think what we characterized in Q3 was that our Electrical Systems and Services business, was doing great, it was in fine shape and we expected that we would continue to post strong growth in that long-cycle business and that's essentially what's happened.No,-- and to the point around pull ahead, no, we're not really seeing any pull ahead at all. As we talked about, we continue to build backlog in that business. It's up some 13% from last year. And so I would say, the way I'd characterize Electrical Systems and Services is, once again very much like the long cycle businesses, it's performing as expected. And we will occasionally find a month or so, where things tend to be lumpy.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, that's great color. Thanks, Craig. And then just maybe to address price and in particular lighting price. It feels like lighting price is getting a lot better. And so I just appreciate your comments in terms of what you're seeing in terms of demand for lighting. Obviously up low-to-mid single digits in 2019. But specifically the price component of that, what are you seeing in the market?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say that lighting prices in general and some of those could be as a function of trade and other things that are perhaps putting a little bit of a floor underneath, some of the pressures that have been coming historically from some of the Chinese imports. But yeah, I would say that it has the pressures in and around lighting have somewhat abated, it still remains a very competitive industry. And historically speaking, if you recall in this business, a lot of the Lighting price give back was really a function of the fact that, you know, the price of semi-conductors and electronics in general continue to fall and those prices were essentially passed on to our customers into the consumers in the form of lower prices of LEDs. And so some of that is also the price of the core electronic components has not -- is not falling at the rate that it has historically. And we've reached a little bit of a bottom on some of that. And I think that's also influencing the fact that Lighting prices are firming somewhat.We did have a much better Q4 with the mid-single digit growth. Our outlook going forward is low to mid single digits. And so we do think that, you know, that the lighting business performs better for sure going into 2019 for Eaton. It becomes no longer a headwind for the business, it becomes a little bit of a tailwind with respect to growth, and so we're enthused by that.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay. I’ll leave it there. Thanks Craig.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystHi, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Julian.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystGood morning. Maybe just a first question around the, the Hydraulics business and the margin profile. As you said, you had some operating inefficiencies in 2017 and 2018. If you could quantify at all, what kind of margin headwind they comprised in 2018 and how quickly you catch up from those in '19 and maybe any other respects in which you’re changing how you sort of manage the productivity and the manufacturing pull-through in that business?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the question, Julian because this has obviously been one of the segments that we spent quite a bit of time talking about during the course of our earnings calls and one of the segments where we did in fact reduce our guidance for the year. And the way we characterize it then and I think it's still largely the case, Julian, is that this industry went through a very significant ramp, a V-shaped recovery. The supply chain and our suppliers in many cases were just not ready for the ramp.And so we had a lot of inefficiencies in the business as a function of having to expedite parts. We had some challenges in ramping up hiring. Not only in our facilities, but our suppliers had the same issues, and so it was just a whole host of inefficiencies associated with an industry that went through a V-shape recovery and we were all caught, a little bit flat-footed. And as a result of that, those inefficiencies, I'd say, if you think about the reduction in our margin guidance for Hydraulics during the course of the year, you can largely say that is about equivalent to the level of inefficiencies that we saw in the business is one of the reasons why we, as we look at the guidance for 2019, we think most of those efficiencies come out of the system and we get to a business once again that's performing more like what we would expect.And so I'd say that while we are not 100% out of the woods, most of the issues that we dealt with during the course of 2018 and the efficiencies therein are largely behind us now.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. And then my second question, I think a lot of the Q&A so far has been on demand dynamics. So maybe switch to talking about capital deployment. A little bit, you did an accelerated share buyback spend in Q4, when the price was down and obviously you've seen a good rebound since, so the timing looks very good on that. Maybe flesh out a little bit how you're thinking about buybacks versus M&A and what kind of M&A appetite you have looking out this year?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, appreciate the question. No, we did like, as you articulated we saw that the overdone Q4 pullback as a real buying opportunity and we did take that opportunity to accelerate some planned purchases into the end of the year. And I'd say, if you think about our capital deployment strategy, I think we’ve laid that out historically, and we talked about as we think about capital deployment, the first call on cash will always be reinvesting in each of our businesses and making sure that every one of our businesses has the capital that they need to be successful and to win in the marketplace. With respect to M&A versus share buyback, we have been out of the M&A market for the last several years, we do, I would say that the environment today is such that we're looking at, perhaps more opportunities and more deals than ever. Pricing continues in some cases to still be a challenge and we've agreed that we're going to maintain our pricing discipline through this period of perhaps pricing being above what we think is reasonable.We've said that our cost of capital is anywhere from 8% to 9%. We want a minimum of 300 basis points over our cost of capital and so we're going to be disciplined through this period. But having said that, we would like to get back into the M&A market and the way I would think about it is, our priority will be largely in and around bolt-on acquisition where you get a lot of leverage within our existing businesses and therefore we can deliver synergies and value in these acquisitions that we acquire.But having said that, in the event that we're not able to put capital to work through M&A, we will generate, as I mentioned, a lot of free cash flow in 2019. We won't let capital build up on the balance sheet and so we'll certainly, in the event that we're not successful in the M&A market will certainly be more aggressive in buying back our shares.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerAnd Julian, if I might add, as you know, we've brought our debt levels actually even a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated after Cooper. And if you just do a quick little math of our midpoint of 3.2 operating cash flow on take out CapEx take out -- of about $600 million, take out dividends, take out the $400 million repurchases. It leaves us with about $1 billion of just excess cash to use on acquisitions or if we don't find them presumably raising our repurchase amount.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I'd add to that, Rick. And we've been -- we've been quite aggressive quite frankly. If you take a look over the last four years, in aggregate, we bought back some 13% of our shares over the last four years and so we are certainly willing to step in when we see these opportunities of weakness and buy the stock back. And given our dividend yield on the current stock prices, we think that it's a tremendous value to buy Eaton at these levels.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystGreat. Thank you very much.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThe next question comes from David Raso with Evercore.David Michael Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, good morning. I apologize, I had phone issues earlier, so I apologize if this has been asked. Just trying to figure out, the first quarter organic is slower than the full year, so obviously there is some assumption of some reacceleration as the year goes on. But the comps don't really get any easier. You mentioned ESS starts the year a little bit slower on the step down. But the backlog for that business has been up double-digit for three quarters, the orders have been obviously lumpy in the third quarter, but two of the three quarters have been strong. So I'm just maybe trying to dig into a little bit more why ESS organic slows that much in the first quarter and if we think of the businesses that you said maybe they started a little bit of a pause period. The acceleration in growth as the year goes on, is that more ESS, is that Aerospace, just trying to understand, so that we have the cadence correct?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question, Dave, and it’s -- we did talk about this a little bit earlier and I think it's really, we talked about just the level of economic uncertainty that exist in the marketplace right now, across so many parts of the world. That's really giving us a little bit of a pause with respect to how aggressive we are on this Q1 number. And so I'd say it's really that issue more than anything that has been baked into our thinking around acceleration. I mean you have Brexit coming up, you have trade disputes with China, you have debt issues in the US and so there is this so many, I’d say -- let's call them geopolitical issues that we are dealing with around the world, that we thought that it would potentially have an impact on Q1 activity levels and naturally what baked into our thinking.David Michael Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystWell, I guess more directly. I'm just trying to figure out. Is there something you're actually seeing, meaning, anything reflective what we saw in September, maybe the backlogs that you have, have a little more, they’re a little bit further out than traditional. I'm just trying to understand how much is -- again prudent understanding of some economic uncertainty right now versus something you're actually seeing that's what I'm trying to dig into it?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes. I'd say that if you characterize the backlog there's really been nothing in terms of the characterization of the backlog whether that's in Electrical Systems and Services or Hydraulics or the other businesses where we build big backlog, the characterization and delivery timeframe of our backlog does not look significantly different than it’s looked historically.David Michael Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay. No, I appreciate the color. Thank you.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.Steve Volkmann -- Jefferies & Co -- AnalystHi, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So just maybe related to that, I mean historically, I guess when ESS orders start to ramp up in backlog stretches out a little bit, there is an opportunity to be a little bit, excuse me, a little bit more aggressive with pricing. Can you just talk about what pricing looks like in your order book in ESS and how much that might have some upside going forward?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think the way we generally think about pricing in general, Steve, is that, you know it's neither a net positive or a net negative as we tend to over time offset commodity driven cost increases with price in the marketplace. And I would say today the pricing environment overall on Electrical Systems and Services is better than it's been, better than it's been largely because the level of economic activity overall has been better over the last 12-months or so.So, I'd say, as we think about price in general, I wouldn't really think about it being a big contributor to pricing, but I think the overall environment today makes it a little bit easier as we think about negotiating with -- on large projects and with customers simply because from a capacity standpoint, in many cases, we are sold out, our competitors are sold out, lead times in some cases have pushed out. And so I do think the environment overall is a little better. It's a function of volume more than anything else in our -- in our factories.Steve Volkmann -- Jefferies & Co -- AnalystOkay. All right, fair enough. And maybe, I'll ask, the only eMobility question, obviously there's lots of platforms that are getting announced for the early '20s, is it too early for you guys to have actually signed any contracts for any of those platforms or is that actually happening?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say that, we have signed some contracts already most of what we signed to date has been relatively small, but I'd ask you to stay tuned.Steve Volkmann -- Jefferies & Co -- AnalystI will stay tuned. Thank you.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThe next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystHey, good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystHi. Just a couple of finer point questions. One, margins in EPG looked a little bit lighter on the incrementals, any -- anything there to point out?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhat we -- what we – what I tried to comment on that one, Jeff, I appreciate the question because as you mentioned margins were a little bit lighter than we anticipated as well and it is largely a function of product mix. And as you think about that to be a very large segment and when you have some of the segments that have lower overall margins growing a little faster, lighting for example, that tends to have an impact on your margins overall. But I'd say, overall absolutely nothing to worry about there, the margins in EP are at very high levels and as you saw in our guidance going forward, we feel very good about 2019.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay, and then Vehicle -- looks like you're calling for the markets to be flat to up and yet organic decline is anything to read into that in terms of share shift or is that just the Cummins JV moving around?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, it's really the Cummins JV and it’s another question I appreciate, Jeff, because there has been a little bit of confusion around the way the JV impacts Eaton. And so I -- so as the JV increases, as the world continues to consume and move from more manual transmissions to automated transmissions that revenue ends up showing up in the joint venture as I mentioned that the JV revenues grew 45% in Q4. And so we obviously get a piece of the profits, but you'll find it as we move forward. The revenues for our business really have to be looked at -- I think largely in combination with the joint venture. If you really want to get a sense for how we're doing in the marketplace, but it's really that issue that is driving essentially the flat revenues.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay, great. Thanks, Craig.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsNext question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystGood morning, everybody.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystQuestion on the margin outlook and price cost, does the 2019 guide embed neutral price cost? You typically do that. And I'm wondering because you're probably going to have carryover pricing benefit that spills into '19 and you may see raw material cost declines as the year progresses?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say, that what we generally do build in, Andy, to exactly your point is we build in neutral. And then there is always a little bit of timing, you know, on the upside and downside depending upon what's happening with commodity prices and so typically speaking as commodity, commodity increase environment, we tend to be a quarter or two behind it. In the deflationary environment we tend to be maybe a quarter or so or two above it. But over the period –of, say a 12-month period, it kind of washes out to be neutral. And that's really what we baked into our plan. Specifically as it relates to tariffs, and what we said in the Q3 earnings call was that we expected $110 million of headwind associated with tariffs. As you know, since then the implementation had been delayed by two-months. So we think that number is now at a $100 million, but our base assumption today still would assume that the tariffs, the Phase III tariffs, moving from 10% to 25% go into effect and that our teams essentially go out and offset that with incremental price, but don't necessarily get a normal incremental margin on the additional tariff driven cost increases.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay. Thank you, Craig. And then, on that 4x impact, the $250 million for the year. Is that heavily weighted to the first quarter?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, it would be more heavily weighted towards the first quarter, just given where the -- how currencies have performed during the course of 2018 that would be largely true.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay. And does that weigh on the margin for the first quarter at all?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I’d say not really. It really doesn't in terms of the margins itself, I mean it really doesn't weigh on the margins. It certainly weighs on EPS for sure, but it really doesn't necessarily weigh on the margin rates.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay. Thank you very much.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsAnd next question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystHi. Good morning, guys. Going back to EP maybe, trying to understand your, your growth guidance a little bit better. I'm trying to figure out exactly how you're thinking about getting to 4% to 5% growth. We really haven't seen order growth to that extent yet. Is this simply a factor of lighting no longer being a headwind and everything else pretty much staying the same or some other end-market acceleration in there?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head with that one. If you think about what we talked about during the course of 2018 where we've made some very specific decisions around our lighting business and walking away from business that wasn't profitable. And during the course of 2018, that business actually contracted some low to mid-single digits. And as we look forward, that goes from a negative to a positive and so that's really what's driving the big difference in the relative growth rate in our EP business.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystAll right, that's helpful. And then back on Vehicle. You're expecting some margin expansion there, even though, obviously revenue is not so much. So what exactly is generating that? And as you look maybe beyond 2019, presumably this, this business is going to start to see some volume deterioration. How do you plan on managing that?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerI'd say, you know, one of the things I would -- we talk about is the fact that we set this joint venture up obviously with Cummins and we don't consolidate the revenue, but we obviously get half of the earnings, and so the JV will see revenue growth, earnings growth in 2019 and that will actually be -- will help us with margin expansion. And then I would say more broadly, I mean, this is just a business and a management team that has just done an outstanding job over decades of very efficiently running our business. And so operational improvements, efficiency improvements, cost out, it's something that we do extraordinarily well as a company and even better within our vehicle business. And so we would fully expect that this business continues to operate at very high levels of margins even in the event of a economic downturn of somewhat.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystThanks.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Andrew Obin with BoA Merrill Lynch.Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHey. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystJust with the economic cycle being so healthy and you guys executing well, how do you think about your capacity overall and North American capacity specifically? How do you deal with these higher volumes?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, no, I'd say that -- it's one of the reasons, Andrew, and I appreciate the question. Our incremental rates, as we provided in our guidance in 2019, are perhaps a little bit less than what we experienced in 2018. It’s because we are having to make some investments in a lot of our businesses that are running at very high levels, whether that's Electrical Systems and Services, whether it's in Aerospace, wemade some really big investments in hydraulics during the course of 2018. And so we are having to reinvest in capacity expansion in many of our businesses that are running at very high levels. And so I think, that's really the way you deal with it. You spend the dollars and you make the investments in -- in some cases, you look at your business models as well around what you invest in and what you rely upon you supply base to do. But by and large, we are making investments to expand our capacity.Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystAnd are you rethinking your global footprint? I mean the ratio where you’re investing, that's what I mean.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhat we've always tried to do is really manufacture in the zone of currency and so what we – we try to minimize the amount of goods that we ship around the world and so what we today sell in Europe, we largely make in Europe and what we today sell in Asia, we largely produce in Asia. And so from a footprint standpoint, there was a lot of work that we've done over, let's say, the last 15 to 20 years around making sure that we have manufacturing capability and facilities in the right regions of the world. Most of that work is largely done and so today it's really expanding where we need to in those regions of the world where we have capacity constraints.Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystAnd just a follow-up, if I can. What's your cadence in China through the year? What are you expecting?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'm sorry your cadence around ...Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOh, just a cadence of revenue growth in China in 2019 through the year, seasonality, however you want to address it? Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes. I have to probably go take a look at that question specifically as it relates to China. I don't have that level of detail in front of me, but I would say that in general what our belief is, is that it's, the Chinese government will likely stimulate at some point. We saw, as you've saw as well, the significant slowdown in the economy in Q4 specifically highlighted by what took place in the light vehicle markets, which were down some 16%. So we believe and I think it is largely believed that the Chinese government will stimulate at some point during the course of the year. So we do think that the second half of the year is stronger than the first half, but beyond that it's difficult to really estimate at this point.Andrew Obin -- BofA Merrill Lynch -- AnalystThank you very much.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsAt this point of time, we’ll have time for one last question, Rob McCarthy with Stephens, please.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens Inc. -- AnalystThanks for fitting me in for the buzzer beater. Can you hear me?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerYeah.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens Inc. -- AnalystSure. Yes, no, two questions. One, just on oil and gas, how do you think about your exposure there, given the fact that you've seen the experience, not only the explicit oil and gas exposure, but the implied bleeding of that oil and gas exposure into your industrial business? How do we think about the outer bound of that as we kind of think about your portfolio going forward and assessing the risk of what could be a continued downdraft here?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the question, Rob, especially given what -- I think we all experienced on the last kind of cyclical downturn in the oil and gas market. And I'd say the first thing, I'd just remind the group that we tend to be more downstream focused than we are upstream focused. So it’s a – it has a much longer cycle. We saw a little bit of a pullback in oil prices in the fourth quarter, but they came rebounding in December. And I would say, by and large our business performed well through Q4 and we've not really seen today any, let's say, significant changes in, in our business in terms of the outlook. The rig count, actually for 2018 actually ended up some 20% for the year when you compare the year overall. And so we think that you know oil and gas is always a bit of a wildcard and tough to predict exactly where it's going. But given that we're really coming off, let's call it a three or four-year pretty significant down draft in oil and gas markets and we’ve just now got our legs underneath us. We think oil and gas holds up over the next number of years, it's difficult to say for certain, but -- but I think our base case would be that, we don't see a significant retrenchment in capital spending around oil and gas.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens Inc. -- AnalystI'll leave it there. Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Don Bullock -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsWith that, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to wrap up the call.

        "What Kind Of Shareholder Appears On The Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) Shareholder Register? – Simply Wall St News": "\n    If you want to know who really controls Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), then you’ll have to look at the makeup of its share registry.\n\n    Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.\n\n    \n      We also tend to see lower insider ownership in companies that were previously publicly owned.\n\n    \n  \n    \n      With a market capitalization of US$31b, Eaton is rather large. We’d expect to see institutional investors on the register. Companies of this size are usually well known to retail investors, too.\n\n    In the chart below below, we can see that\n\n      institutional investors have bought into the company.\n    \n    Let’s take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholder can tell us about ETN.\n  \n\n\n        Check out our latest analysis for Eaton\n      \n\n\nWant to help shape the future of investing tools? Participate in a short research study and receive a subscription valued at $60.\n\n    Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n  \n    Eaton already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 82% of the company.\n\n    This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong.\n\n    If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It’s therefore worth looking at Eaton’s earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n  \n    Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions.\n\n  \n    \n    We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Eaton.\n    \n    There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\n  The definition of company insiders can be subjective, and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least.\n  \n  The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.\n\n  I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\n  \n    Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Eaton Corporation plc.\n\n\n      It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amount to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$70m worth of shares (at current prices).\n\n      It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. \n\n\t\t\tThe general public holds a 18% stake in ETN.\n\n\t\t\tWhile this group can’t necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\t\t\n    It’s always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Eaton better, we need to consider many other factors.\n  \nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n    \n      If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.\n    NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.\nTo help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

        "Here’s What Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) P/E Ratio Is Telling Us – Simply Wall St News": "\n    This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). \n    We’ll look at Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) P/E ratio and reflect on what it tells us about the company’s share price. \n    Based on the last twelve months, Eaton’s P/E ratio is 14.62.\n    In other words, at today’s prices, investors are paying $14.62 for every $1 in prior year profit.\n\n  \n\n\n        See our latest analysis for Eaton\n      \n\nWant to help shape the future of investing tools and platforms? Take the survey and be part of one of the most advanced studies of stock market investors to date.\n  The formula for price to earnings  is:\n\n  Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for Eaton:\n \nP/E of 14.62 = $71.87 ÷ $4.92 \n  (Based on the year to September 2018.)\n\n\n  A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings.\n  All else being equal, it’s better to pay a low price — but as Warren Buffett said, ‘It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.’\n\n    Earnings growth rates have a big influence on P/E ratios.\n    When earnings grow, the ‘E’ increases, over time.\n    That means unless the share price increases, the P/E will reduce in a few years.\n    So while a stock may look expensive based on past earnings, it could be cheap based on future earnings.\n\n    Eaton’s earnings per share fell by 23% in the last twelve months.\n    \n      But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 12%.\n    \n    \n\n  We can get an indication of market expectations by looking at the P/E ratio.\n    The image below shows that Eaton has a P/E ratio that is roughly in line with the electrical industry average (15.5).\n\n    Its P/E ratio suggests that Eaton shareholders think that in the future it will perform about the same as other companies in its industry classification.\n\n\n  So if Eaton actually outperforms its peers going forward, that should be a positive for the share price.\n  Checking factors such as the tenure of the board and management could help you form your own view on if that will happen.\n\n  The ‘Price’ in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company.\n  Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company.\n  In theory, a company can lower its future P/E ratio by using cash or debt to invest in growth.\n\n  Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.\n\n    Eaton’s net debt is 22% of its market cap.\n    It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.\n\n  \n    Eaton has a P/E of 14.6. That’s below the average in the US market, which is 17.1.\n    \n      \n        Since it only carries a modest debt load, it’s likely the low expectations implied by the P/E ratio arise from the lack of recent earnings growth.\n      \n \n\n  Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.\n\n    As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.’\n\n\n    So this free report on the analyst consensus forecasts could help you make a master move on this stock.\n\n\nOf course you might be able to find a better stock than Eaton. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly. \nTo help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

        "Eaton Agrees to Acquire Controlling Interest in Ulusoy Elektrik, Expanding IEC Offerings in EMEA ": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Power management company Eaton (NYSE:ETN) has reached a definitive \n      agreement to acquire an 82.275 percent controlling interest in Ulusoy \n      Elektrik Imalat Taahhut ve Ticaret A.S. (IST:ULUSE), a leading \n      manufacturer of switchgear based in Ankara, Turkey, with a primary focus \n      on medium voltage solutions for industrial and utility customers. The \n      purchase price for the shares is approximately $214 million on a cash \n      and debt free basis. This constitutes the entire shareholding of both \n      privileged and ordinary shares of sellers Sait Ulusoy, Kubilay Hakki \n      Ulusoy, Enis Ulusoy and Akgul Ulusoy, and accounts for 90.153 percent of \n      the outstanding voting rights.\n    \n      On a Turkish Financial Reporting Standards basis, Ulusoy Elektrik had \n      sales for the trailing 12-month period ending September 30, 2018, of 555 \n      million lira ($126 million based on the average exchange rate for the \n      period) and EBIT of 158 million lira ($36 million converted on the same \n      basis). A reconciliation of Net Income to EBIT follows this press \n      release.\n    \n      Established in 1985, the company employs approximately 780 people and \n      has manufacturing facilities in Turkey and Indonesia. Products include \n      medium-voltage switchgear, medium-voltage distribution transformers, \n      substation kiosks, and medium-voltage cable connection systems.\n    \n      “The acquisition of Ulusoy Elektrik complements Eaton’s IEC portfolio \n      and strengthens our ability to provide tailored medium-voltage solutions \n      that span the full range of requirements,” said Revathi Advaithi, \n      president and chief operating officer, Electrical Sector. “In addition, \n      it adds a competitive, high-capability manufacturing base and provides \n      us with additional access to the medium-voltage market in Europe, the \n      Middle East, and Africa.”\n    \n      The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and \n      regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first half of 2019. \n      As part of the agreement, certain unrelated businesses with expected \n      revenue in 2018 of approximately $3 million are not included in this \n      transaction. The final purchase price will be adjusted up or down for \n      the level of net cash delivered at closing. As required by the Turkish \n      capital markets legislation, Eaton plans to file an application to \n      execute a mandatory tender offer for the remaining shares shortly after \n      the transaction closes.\n    \n      This news release contains forward-looking statements concerning the \n      expected closing date of the acquisition of Ulusoy Elektrik, and the \n      subsequent mandatory tender offer for remaining shares, some of which \n      may be outside the company’s control. The following factors could cause \n      actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking \n      statements: unexpected difficulties obtaining regulatory approvals or \n      satisfying closing conditions and unanticipated difficulties completing \n      the mandatory tender offer.

        "\n      \n    Eaton Looks Like a Good Investment for Dividend Hunters ": "Returns as of 5/1/2020Returns as of 5/1/2020Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Some stocks just go out of favor for no clear reason, and high-yielding Eaton Corp. (NYSE:ETN) looks like one of them -- the stock trades near the bottom of its peer group in terms of valuation. However, management's guidance calls for ongoing margin expansion and strong free cash flow (FCF) generation in the coming years. With a well-supported current dividend yield of 3.6%, investors might want to ask what's going on, and whether Eaton's stock is due a revaluation.Compared to its peers Eaton looks undervalued. As you can see in the chart below the company trades toward the bottom of its peer group on an FCF-based valuation.It's true that Eaton faces cyclically risk, but then again so does a company like 3M (NYSE:MMM) which the market seems willing to give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to growth prospects.  3M has a lot of short-cycle business which could slow given any deterioration in the economy. Eaton's yield will attract income-seeking investors. Image source: Getty ImagesMoreover, Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) had a good first quarter of 2019 and maintained full-year guidance, but the stock is still dependent on capital spending trends in the industrial sector -- the first thing that gets cut in a slowdown.Furthermore, if you are worried about long-term growth and margin prospects in Eaton's core electrical products and electrical systems and services segments, then it's not clear why Schneider Electric, Legrand, or even ABB should trade at a premium to Eaton.ETN Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsAll told, Eaton looks undervalued compared to its peers. Check out the latest earnings call transcript for Eaton Corporation.The recent investor day presentations saw management affirm that the company was on track to hit its 2015-2020 aims. You can see the key parts of the guidance below.2015-2020 Targets2019 GuidanceAnnual Revenue Growth2%-4%4%-5%Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin14%-15%14%-14.5%FCF from sales>10%11%-12%Annual EPS growth8%-9%9%Data source: Eaton Corporation presentations.Moreover, management expects to generate $8 billion in FCF in the next three years -- a figure that will cover the expected dividend payout of $3.5 billion 2.3 times over, meaning there are no worries about the sustainability of its dividend. In addition, it will have around $1.5 billion left over annually to buy back shares or make earnings-enhancing acquisitions. Put another way, Eaton expects to generate 24% of its market cap in FCF in the next three years.Based on management's expectations Eaton looks attractive, but the question is whether the company will hit its targets or not. And there's little doubt that some of the company's end markets face pressure.For example, industrial production growth is set to slow in 2019, and around a third of Eaton's electrical businesses sell into machine builders and industrial facilities -- and the hydraulics segment also has exposure. Meanwhile, its vehicle segment has heavy exposure to the trucking industry, a market set to slow in the coming years. That said, as you can see below Eaton has exposure to plenty of other end markets, such as utilities, commercial construction, data centers (electrical businesses), aerospace, and construction equipment (hydraulics).Data source: Eaton Corporation presentations. Chart by author.Provided the economy avoids a recession, it looks likely that Eaton can still grow earnings in the next few years -- not a bad result considering the stock looks undervalued based on its current earnings alone.Moreover, even if there is a slowdown Eaton's stock should be able to withstand the pressure. FCF generation could suffer, but as we've already it's so strong that the company could conceivably use the cash flow to buy a low-single-digit percentage of its own stock if it falls.Management also outlined that its efforts to expand margin in recent years means its next earnings margin trough is likely to be higher than the last cycle's peak margin in 2005.In addition, management expects to spend just 5.5%-6% of sales on capital expenditures and research & development. Compare this with 3M's figure of around 11%. In other words, if the economy slows Eaton won't be caught investing a significant part of its revenue in products just as the market turns sour.ETN EBIT Margin (TTM) data by YChartsEaton isn't an exciting growth stock, and it's unlikely to shoot the lights out in terms of performance, but those aren't things every investor is necessarily looking for.The stock has a cyclical risk, and it's likely to get pushed around by economic sentiment. However, if you can ignore the noise and you're looking for an undervalued, high-yielding stock with a dividend that's likely to grow even in a slowdown, then Eaton is a good choice.Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

        "Are Insiders Selling Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Stock? – Simply Wall St News": "\n  We’ve lost count of how many times insiders have accumulated shares in a company that goes on to improve markedly.\n  On the other hand, we’d be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business.\n  So shareholders might well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN).\n\n  It’s quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time.\n  However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.\n\n  We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing.\n  But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.\n  For example, a Columbia University study found that ‘insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers’.\n\n\n\n        View our latest analysis for Eaton\n      \n\n\n\nPrincipal Financial Officer & Director Richard Fearon made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$80.25 each.\n      That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$82.64).\n      While their view may have changed since they sold, this isn’t a particularly bullish sign.\n      We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling on market, especially if they did so below the current price.\n        It is worth noting that this sale was only 11.8% of Richard Fearon’s holding.\n\n  In the last twelve months insiders netted US$16m for 192.11k shares sold.\n \n  Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Eaton shares, than buying.\n  The average sell price was around US$81.09.\n        We don’t gain much confidence from insider selling near the recent share price.\n        While some insiders have decided to take some money off the table, we wouldn’t put too much weight on this fact.\n\nYou can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by individuals) over the last 12 months, below.\nBy clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!\n\n    For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\n\n    The last three months saw significant insider selling at Eaton.\n    In total, insiders sold US$9.2m worth of shares in that time, and we didn’t record any purchases whatsoever.\n    In light of this it’s hard to argue that all the directors think that the shares are a bargain.\n\n\n  Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own.\n  We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership.\n  \n  \n    It appears that Eaton insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$89m.\n    This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.\n\n\n  Insiders sold Eaton shares recently, but they didn’t buy any.\n          Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn’t show any insider buying. \n         \n\n            Insiders own shares, but we’re still pretty cautious, given the history of sales.\n            So we’d only buy after careful consideration. \n\n  Of course, the future is what matters most. So if you are interested in Eaton, you should check out this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\n \n\nIf you would prefer to check out another company — one with potentially superior financials — then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt. \nWe aim to bring you long-term focused research analysis driven by fundamental data.

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Yan Jin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsGood morning. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton's First Quarter 2019 Earning Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO, and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer.Our agenda today includes the opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the first quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today, have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com.Please note that both press release and the presentation include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is available on our website and will be available for replay.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to expected future results of the Company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risk and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation, that are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.And with that, I'll turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Jin. Appreciate it. Yeah, I'll begin with page 3 and the highlights of our Q1 results, and I begin by saying, we had a good start to the year with another strong quarter of performance.Earnings per share were $1.23 on a GAAP basis and $1.26 excluding the impact of the divestiture costs related to the announced spin-off of our Lighting business. At $1.26, our results were 15% above last year and toward the higher end of our guidance range, which as you'll recall was $1.18 to $1.28. Our sales were $5.3 billion, up 4% organically and in line with our guidance, excluding the negative 3% impact from currency. And we continue to be pleased with our strong margin performance. Segment margins were 16% above the high end of our guidance range and 80 basis points over prior year.We also generated very strong operating cash flows of $551 million in the quarter, and this is up 63% from Q1 '18 and a first quarter record. And lastly, we repurchased $150 million of shares in the quarter as part of our plan to buy back $400 million of shares in 2019. So, a very good start to the year.Page 4 summarizes our income statement versus prior year. And I've covered most of these items in the summary comments and so I'll only point out once again, the 3% currency impact was driven primarily by the important currencies for us which are the euro, renminbi and real. We're very pleased with our 32% incremental rate that we delivered on organic growth. And so, that number was, once again, very strong and above our expectations. And we incurred as we mentioned, the $0.03 per share from the after-tax cost primarily related to the spin of our Lighting business. And as you can see adjusted earnings per share increased from 9%.Next, we summarize the quarterly results of our Electrical Products segment. Revenue here increased 2%, which includes 5% organic growth, partially offset by 3% currency. And we see particularly strength here in commercial and in residential construction with global growth rates in the mid-to-high single digits and even stronger in the US markets. Our orders increased 4% led by continued stroke, strength and growth in the Americas and our backlog grew double digits, up 13% in the quarter.Segment operating profits grew 8% and operating margins were 120 basis points increase to 18.9% and this was a record for Q1. And we're actually pleased with how well the segment is performing and the consistency of results that we continue to see in this part of the Company.Moving to page 6, we cover our Electrical Systems and Services results. Revenues here increased 6% with organic growth of 8%, partially offset by 2% currency and we saw especially strong double-digit revenue growth in commercial construction and in data centers. We continued to have solid momentum in this business and the year had started on a high note for sure. You'll recall that our original guidance is for sales to be up 5% to 6% organically for the year, and so we're certainly running above that rate.As we indicated at our Investor Conference in March, we've moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting our orders in this long-cycle business, as well as in our Aerospace business that I'll cover soon. On a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders actually increased 8% with strength in all major end markets and regions.And maybe, I'll just pause for a moment on the orders here in the Electrical Systems and Services because I know it's a particular point of question that many of you have and I will tell you that our ES&S activity level is absolutely performing in line and perhaps maybe even a little bit better than what we anticipated. And we talked about this idea of moving to the rolling 12 months, because we do in fact see a lot of, let's say, call it lumpiness in the orders that we get in Electrical Systems and Services driven primarily by what we're seeing in hyperscale data centers.And the other indicator that we have that gives us a lot of confidence in the strength of this business is, is what we call negotiations. And our negotiations in this business in Q1 were an all-time record and up some 56% from prior year. And so despite what we're seeing actually in the orders and what some of you have reported to be a little bit of weakness versus what we saw in Q4, the overall underlying activity in this business continues to be very, very strong. Our backlog continued to grow, it was up 11% in the quarter. We generated strong operating leverage with operating profits increasing 15%, only 8% volume growth and margins increasing a 100 basis points to 13.1%.You'll also recall that we announced the acquisition of the Ulusoy Electric business in January. We're pleased to have closed the purchase on April 15th and then this acquisition will certainly provide a strong platform for us as we serve our customers in EMEA and the Asia-Pacific markets. So once again, a really strong performance in our Electrical Systems and Services business and we continue to be quite bullish on the -- for the outlook for that business as we go forward.On the next page, we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q1. Revenues were down 3%, with 1% organic growth more than offset by a 4% currency. I'll certainly note that we had some tough comps in this business at 6% organic growth in Q1 '18, but revenue did slow slightly more than we expected, but I would probably note here only slightly more than what we had in our original plans for the year.Organic growth of 1% reflected continued growth in construction equipment, but some declines in ag and in industrial equipment. Our orders stepped down 11%, driven principally by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and we also had tough comps here as well from last year, where orders were up some 14%. Backlog declined 6% in the quarter as well. And as we detailed at our Investor Conference, we continue to work through some inefficiencies in the business, but do expect to see strong margin performance in this business in the second half of the year as we work off some of the efficiency issues that we experienced in the second half of last year. And segment margins were 11.7%, down 100 basis points versus last year.And on page 8, we summarize our Q1 results for the Aerospace business. And as you can see, this business just continues to perform at a very high level, delivering record performance across almost every single metric. Our revenues increased 10%, a 11% organic growth and 1% negative currency. Like ES&S, we moved to a rolling 12-month basis for reporting orders. And on this basis, orders increased 18% with particular strength in commercial transport, military fighters, military transport and both commercial and military aftermarket. So really strength across the board in this segment.Our backlog also increased significantly, up some 21% in the quarter. And lastly, we demonstrated very strong incremental margins with labor to add to a 30% increase and operating profits and a 300 basis point margin improvement in the quarter. Operating margins of 23.1%, another all-time high for the business. So in addition to the volume growth, we also experienced some favorable product mix in the quarter, but really strong execution by the team overall.Next, I'll move to a summary of our Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 9%, which includes 6% reduction in organic growth and a negative 3% from currency. The organic sales decline was driven by a combination of declines in like global vehicle markets, which were down 45% and the ongoing impact of revenue transfers to the Eaton Cummins joint venture. And I will note that the joint venture actually saw revenue increases of 27% in the quarter and continues to perform very well. We also had tough comps in this business with organic growth, which increased 13% last year. But overall, this business is really performing as we've expected, but with a little bit of weakness in global automotive markets.For the year, we continue to expect NAFTA Class 8 production to be at 324,000 units, flat with 2018. But we have lowered our outlook for low -- for light vehicle markets for the year. And lastly, despite the lower volumes, operating margins increased 30 basis points to 15.1% and a decrement of margin on the organic of less than 20%. So really strong execution by the team, once again, in our Vehicle business.And wrapping up our segment summaries, we'll cover our eMobility segment on page 10. Revenues were up 8%, which includes 9% organic growth, partially offset by 1% currency. And as planned, we continue to accelerate our R&D spending, which increased by some 130% in the quarter. So we continue to invest heavily in this segment to participate in what we think is really an exciting growth opportunity as we move forward.We're certainly optimistic about the opportunities in this rapidly developing market, and our pursuit pipeline for new programs has actually now grown to $1.1 billion. At our Investor Conference in March, we did announce a new program win of a $100 million mature year revenue for traction and (inaudible) with a major global OEM customer and actually in mid-April, we announced that PSA is the customer for this program.This was our first significant event, since creating the segment about one year ago, and we're certainly ahead of our original schedule for growth in this segment and well on our way to accreting what we think is going to be a new $2 billion to $4 billion segment for the Company overall.At this point, I'll turn to our outlook for 2019, which is on page 11. We now expect organic revenues for all of Eaton to grow approximately 4%, down slightly from our prior midpoint of 4.5% and this is largely the result of us increasing our guidance for our long-cycle businesses by reducing guidance for our short-cycle businesses. Specifically, we increased organic growth rates by 1% for both ES&S and Aerospace. And for Hydraulics, we lowered organic growth by 2% at the midpoint to 3% to 4% based upon some slow growth expectations in global mobile equipment markets. And for Vehicle coming off, what I'd say really was a weak Q1 in light vehicle markets, we lowered our organic growth rate by 3 points at the midpoint, and now we expect organic growth to be down some 4% to 5%, and once again, due to primarily the automotive side of the business itself. And we've not changed electrical products or eMobility.And our margin expectations are noted on page 12. We are modestly raising our guidance from 17.1% to 17.5% or 17.3% at the midpoint. We're lowering the margin expectations for Hydraulics by 60 basis points to 13.4% to 14% and for Vehicle by 90 basis points to 16.5% to 17.1% due to lower organic growth primarily. But this is more than offset by increases in Electrical Products and in Aerospace margins. Our new expectation for Electrical Products is for margins to be between 19% and 19.6%, a 50 basis point increase at the midpoint and the new expectation for Aerospace is for margins to be 21.8% to 22.4%, also a 40 basis point increase at the midpoint. And the other two segments remain unchanged. So at the midpoint, 17.3% and this would naturally be another record level of performance for Eaton overall.And lastly on page 13, we summarize our guidance for Q2 and for the year. For Q2, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.45 and $1.55 and at the midpoint, this represents an 8% increase over last year. Other assumptions in our guidance include, we're expecting 4% organic growth, foreign exchange impact of roughly $100 million. Our margin expectation for the quarter is that have margins between 17.2% and 17.6%. We'd expect our corporate cost to be flat with Q2 of '18 and we'd expect the tax rate of between 13.5% and 14.5%.For the full-year 2019, we're raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72 to $6.02 for the midpoint of $5.87, which includes essentially a $0.02 impact from the full-year impact of the acquisition of Ulusoy overall. At the midpoint, this continues to represent a 9% increase over 2018. Other full-year guidance assumptions include organic revenue growth of 4%. We'd expect $100 million of revenue from the Ulusoy acquisition. We expect foreign exchange impact to be $300 million and this is a $50 million increase from prior guidance. We'd expect, as I mentioned, segment margin of 17.3% and really no change to the other items in our forecast.So in summary, I'd say another strong start for the year in Q1. We're well positioned to deliver another year of record results and we're absolutely thrilled with the way that the Company is performing overall.So with that, I'll turn it back to Yan for Q&A.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOkay. Thanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session of our call today, I do see we have members of individuals peers (ph) that in the queue is present. So given our time constraint over to be an hour today and our desire to get to as many of these questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up.So with that, I will turn it over to our operator to give you guys the guidance.Operator(Operator Instructions)Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOkay. We'll take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThanks. Good morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Joe.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystCraig, could you maybe expand on your comments on commercial and data centers being up double digits in ESS this quarter? We heard some conflicting news, especially in the data center side, out of the supply chain. And so any other further color you can provide there would be helpful.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, now the only thing I'd tell you that, overall the data center market for us continues to perform very well. We are still running as I mentioned, our revenue is up double digit for data center sales. Activity levels continue to be quite strong. I think the piece that I -- that we're trying to clarify for the sake of all of you who follow the Company, that data center orders, especially when you -- when it comes to the hyperscale, they tend to be quite lumpy. So, you'll get a big slug of orders in one quarter and they'll be lighter the next quarter, and so that's why we made this decision to really move to a rolling 12 months, because we think it more accurately reflects the underlying economic activity that we're seeing in that market. But for us, we still see very good strength and data center activity overall, and we continue to think that's going to be one of our fastest growing segments.I mentioned once again, we take a look at negotiations, which is the level which for us is a good proxy for the level of economic activity that's taking place in the market. And as I mentioned, we're really experiencing record levels of activity in our Electrical Systems and Services business, but negotiation is up 56% in the quarter to record levels. And so, by and large, we've really seen no let up in activity in Electrical Systems and Services and data centers continues to be a bright spot for us.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystAnd Craig, within commercial, what are the verticals that are really driving the strength there?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say we're really seeing pretty broad-based strengths in the commercial businesses overall. And certainly, oil and gas is -- has come back and we mentioned this to strengthen data centers. We...Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerYeah, for example if you look at straight up commercial like office and government, both up just over 10% institutional, just a little bit under that. But we are seeing broad-based strength in the commercial side of things. And if you look at some of the governmental data, C30 reports except for our -- the new Dodge report Europe has seen, numbers that are high-single digit, even low double-digits. So it, it's all pretty consistent.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerRight. It's all of -- it's broad too and we're seeing also strength really around the world as well. And in commercial businesses in general. So it's not just in the US market.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystNow, that's helpful. Maybe my follow-on just on the Hydraulics business. You know it's interesting, because it sounded like when we had met intra-quarter, that Hydraulics had maybe gotten off to a better start in January, February. And you've talked about this, this business and all your businesses meeting to kind of earn the right to be part of the portfolio. Yet, we've taken guidance down already to start the year. And so can you just kind of contextualize how the quarter went with Hydraulics? And then also in terms of -- like how it fits with the portfolio longer term?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerFirst of all I'd say, as we've talked about and recovered during our Investor Day in general, that we have some work to do to fix, what I'd call some self-inflicted wounds associated with some short move transition, site transition that we're managing internally as an organization. And we always believed that was going to be more of a kind of a second half kind of resolution to some of the internal issues. I think the new news for us in the Hydraulics business in terms of what really drove the reduction guidance is largely some of the weakness that we're seeing in some of our end markets. And so, I'd say operationally as we acknowledge, we still have work to do to fix some of our own inefficiencies and our teams are working that. And we certainly would expect that stuff to be flushed through the system by the time we hit the second half of the year. But the new piece is really some of the weakness that we're seeing, largely in some of the mobile equipment market.And I'd say that our orders were certainly weak in Q1. If you take a look at some of our customers, all the names that you know well, I'd say their sales are holding up better than our orders are. And so there could be a better outlook as we look forward. We're not sure to what extent. There's some inventory repositioning taking place in this segment. But right now, it's really more a function of weaker volumes. And at this point, I'd say as we think about Hydraulics as a part of Eaton overall, today, we have a plan and the plan is a plan that we believe in. And our team is executing that plan and we fully expect the Hydraulics team to fix their operational issues and turn that into a business that we can all be proud of and would anticipate keeping as a part of the Company. But for Hydraulics, no different to any other part of the Company, we have expectations that we call all of our businesses accountable to. And we would expect them to meet the criteria that we set and if we can't meet the criteria for Hydraulics or for any part of the Company, we are willing to act when necessary.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question is coming from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystThank you. Good morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Jeff.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystGood morning. I was wondering if you could just come back to ESS one more time anyhow? And just give us some color on what -- negotiation is up 36% (ph) really means obviously it sounds good. Is that kind of a project value in dollars? Was there some kind of low ebb in Q1 last year that results in that being such a big healthy number and what kind of typical conversion rate would you have on kind of a negotiation?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, no. I mean, I -- the first thing I'll just answer is kind of the question around noise. There is absolutely nothing in Q1 of last year that would suggest that we had a low bar to clear. As I mentioned, it not only was higher than Q1 last year, but it was a record all-time level and was significantly higher than any other quarter during the course of 2018. And I think just as you articulate, this is essentially the number of bid and quotations that we're making to our various customers on large projects that we bid on during the course of the period. And so, it really for us is probably the best proxy for the level of underlying economic activity that we have in that business. So we think it's a really strong indicator of the fact that this business, a long-cycle business that we'd expect to be performing very well at this point in the cycle, is actually performing very much like we anticipate.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerAnd it will take time for some of these negotiation bids to become final bids, typically 90 days to 180 days, sometimes a little longer for big projects. But yet, it is quite notable just how strong the activity levels are.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystAnd just as a follow-up separately on Ulusoy. Is it $0.02 accretive for the year, and therefore the sole reason for the guide or you'd actually more than that and there's maybe a negative offset somewhere else in the equation?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerNo, it's $0.02 accretive and the way to think about it Jeff is, it's really $0.04 accretive, but we have $0.02 of our estimate right now of amortization of intangible costs. And so, that's how it ends up at $0.02.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystGreat. Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerBut we are in fact holding all the other elements of the guide for the core business, and so no change at all.Jeffrey T. Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question is coming from Scott Davis from Melius Research.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystRight. Good morning, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Scott.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerGood morning.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystJust to be clear, the reason why you're not raising margin guidance on ESS, is that because of mix and largely just because of the data center volumes, is that correct?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I'd say that -- first of all, I'd say early in the year. I'd say that our forecast for margins in ES&S is certainly today within the range that we set for the year. And a lot of the growth to your point, is coming from projects and so we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. But right now, I would not in any way take it as a sign of concern about margins in our ES&S business. Things are going quite well and we are very pleased with our margins in Q1 and there's nothing today that I'd say that would suggest that -- if there's anything to be concerned about.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystOkay. And the -- (inaudible) just kind of get your take Craig, on some of the M&A that's out there. I mean you've got a couple of competitors who have announced really big deals. Nothing seems cheap. They all seem to be relatively fully priced. But what's your take on the market out there and the likelihood that Eaton participates? I guess, there's two ways to think about it, you could be a seller of assets into this market of strength as easily as you could be a buyer of assets. So how do you think about that at -- in the current?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe first thing with respect to pricing and asset values in as you can see by some of the transactions that have been announced, I mean these properties are going for extraordinary prices. We have prided ourselves on the fact that we said we're going to be disciplined through this cycle, and we think that our cost of capital continues to be 8% to 9% and we want to deliver 300 basis points over our cost of capital. And so we will continue to be a disciplined buyer into a market that looks like assets being priced at extraordinary levels. And so I'd say that we today, are looking at probably more deals than we have in a very long time, and so we have a very active pipeline as well. But we will make the commitment as we have in the past. We're not going to chase deals with what I'd say are unattractive returns when you look at their cash on cash set of financial metrics. So that's kind of the way we look at it.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystBut the other side of that, obviously Craig, as you could sell something, I mean if people are willing to pay for a price and maybe now is the time to think about partnering with some of maybe a more cyclical stocks, is that a possibility?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. What I'd say is -- first of all, I'd say we took a look at our businesses strategically through the cycle. And so as we think about the portfolio itself and how we hold to a seller, we're really trying to look at them over the long-term period and whether or not we think this is going to be a good strategic hole based upon the criteria that we established through the cycle.Now having said that to your point, if you have come to a decision that you want to exit as asset, now would be a great time to do it. But we generally take a longer term, let's say, more strategic view of the portfolio in terms of things that we want to -- businesses that we want to be in versus businesses that we would choose to exit.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystThat's fair. Thank you and good luck to you guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right, thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystYeah, thanks. Good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerGood morning, Nicole.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystSo I just want to focus a little bit on Hydraulics. I know organic growth was 1% this quarter. Looks like in your full-year guidance you've brought it down a little bit, but you're still basically implying some improvement organic growth throughout the year. So I guess, I'm curious what's driving that conviction and maybe just frame that with how demand progressed throughout the quarter, if there was any sign of improvement in March or into early April?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say that -- maybe to take your first question right out of the gate in terms of, certainly we're implying a little bit stronger growth in the back half of the year than we delivered in Q1. As I mentioned in my opening commentary, that 1% organic growth was actually within 1% of our internal plan. And so, we are actually not off our internal plan by a measurable amount in Q1. And the comps get easier quite frankly, as we -- as the year moves on. And we have very specific programs that we're working on as a company that will also help boost growth as we look into some of the out-quarters, very specific initiatives that we're working on, that have been largely bedded down, that are going to help improve our growth.And the other thing I would tell you is that, if you take a look at the major end markets that we serve construction equipment, ag equipment, two of our big important markets in Hydraulics and you look at what our customers are saying, in most cases, they're still forecasting growth for the year. They're forecasting low single-digit kind of growth levels. And so we do believe that there was a little bit of inventory correction that took place in Q1 that probably also held down our relative growth rate.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, got it. Thanks, Craig. And then just shifting to Aerospace, the margin performance was really impressive this quarter. Was there anything special going on there? Is it a mix impact that isn't sustainable throughout the rest of the year just because the full-year guidance implies a little bit less margin expansion than we saw in the first quarter?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean it certainly was a record quarter for margins in Aerospace, an all-time record, not just a record for Q1 and I would say that we did have a bit of favorable mix in Q1. Our aftermarket business on a relative basis was a bit stronger than our core OE business, and that certainly was a help for the quarter, but also the growth in the volume as well also helped push things up.And so I would say, principally, it was more a function of the mix of customers and the mix of OE aftermarket that really led to a really strong Q1 performance, that is probably not sustainable at those levels. But as you can see, we are forecasting margins for Aerospace that are once again at record levels and I'd say even in many cases industry-leading levels.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGot it. Thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystHi, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Ann.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerHi.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystJust back to ESS again, I know you said bidding is up significantly, but traditionally what kind of success rates would you have -- would do -- have been, what percent win versus not win have you had?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe have pretty strong market share Ann, in our businesses. As you know, I mean, in our Electrical Systems and Services business, a lot of this activity is in the Americas market and we have industry-leading shares in this business. And so our win rate is going to be very much consistent with our underlying market share. So we do believe that this bidding activity will translate ultimately to growth in our business.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystOkay, that's helpful color. Appreciate it. And then back to Hydraulics also, I have to ask the question about North American agriculture, of course. Maybe you could talk about what your customers are saying there? Is that where the weakness was in the quarter in term of orders? And given how bad farmer sentiment is in the US, would you anticipate that maybe staying weaker than expected for the full year?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean, you're absolutely right that sales were actually quite decent in ag in Q1. But the order rates in ag was down. And to your point, it's farm incomes and underlying commodity prices being as weak as they are, that we think are certainly dampening some of the enthusiasm for the outlook in ag markets. And I think our call on ag for the year, we felt like it's kind of a low single-digit kind of grower for the year, but we do think that there is at least a cautionary kind of sentiment that's in the market today in and around ag in general.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan Securities -- AnalystYeah, I would think we would have a similar view of the ag market for '19 and maybe even into '20. Okay, I'll leave it there just get back in line. Most of my other questions were answered. Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks. Good morning, guys.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerHi.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Nigel.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystJust come back to Hydraulics and the backlog was down, I think 11% and I understand the backup is coming off a very high level. But I'm just wondering to get to your sort of 4% to 5% growth for the remainder of the year in Hydraulics, do have to see orders come back positive or can we still achieve that targets with orders remaining flat to negative?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, yeah. The backlog Nigel was actually down 6%.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystSorry.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerVersus last year, but do not -- no problem at all, but I think the spirit of your question is once again very much like the question asked earlier, what gives us confidence that we can deliver the growth and the outlook for the year and I will say that while the backlog is down, it's still running at very, very high levels from a historical perspective. And so, we -- and obviously the comparisons in general, the comps in general, get easier as the year wears on. And I think that's really the big message with respect to orders, with respect to sales, is that you have relatively easier comps as the year unwinds.We have some very specific initiatives that we have put in place as a company that are going to give us some growth that have been very well identified and we think once again that while there is a little bit of caution in the market, we do believe that the two big markets of ag and construction continue to grow down the year.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, great. And then my follow-on question is the three-point delta on the Vehicle outlook. And obviously, we're looking at the light vehicle markets significantly weaker. So that's explainable, because I'm just wondering, given the complexity in the segments, how much of that revenue delta is caused by a shift between your legacy transmission business and the Cummins JV? Was that a factor at all? Any help there would be great.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean, think in terms of the -- you say the 3 point reduction in the growth for the quarter, I'd say that was really driven principally by the weakness in global light vehicle markets around the world and you see the same data that we see. I mean China was down 10%; Europe was down for say, 3% to 4%; the Americas was down a couple of points and so, most of that weakness I'd say, is really in the global light vehicle market.We do have, by the way, as I mentioned in my commentary, as the world moves from mails to automated transmissions, we continue to move more revenue into the joint venture with Cummins and that is a piece of what's going on in that business and the other one by the way, that I'll put it on the table because it becomes a much bigger impact in terms of the legacy business as we move forward. As the world moves to electrification and the eMobility segment, that also become revenue that comes out of our legacy vehicle business and shows up in eMobility. And so there are a number of factors that are going on that perhaps make the underlying revenue growth and our Vehicle business look worse than it really is.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, Craig. We will dig in offline. Thanks very much.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsNext question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystHey. Good morning, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Jeff.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystJust two on EPG, one, can you just talk about what's driving the margin bump without a change in sales? And then two, just as the Lighting spend has been announced, have you gotten any indications of interest that maybe a sale is likely or more likely than it's been? Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, I'd say on the margins, largely in EPG, I'd say primarily we're getting better execution and better conversion in the business than we originally anticipated when we put the plan together. And so, it really complements to the team for really executing and delivering on some of the cost-out initiatives that we put in the plan. And so things are just going a little better than what we anticipated. And that's kind of what drove the increase in guidance for the year.As we mentioned in terms of Lighting, first of all I'd say that the process is moving along as we anticipated and the prime path continues to be to spin the business and we still expect to be ready to make sure that we can get that done by the end of the year. To your point specifically around outside interest, yes. As you can imagine, there has been a number of companies who raised an interest in potentially acquiring the business and (inaudible). It's always good to have an option in of choice and so we will be obviously working through these two alternatives, but once again, the prime path that we're on, is to spin the business.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay and then just macro level on Europe, I mean there's been some talk about slowing there, you mentioned the auto. Can you just talk about any areas of resilience or particular weakness in Europe? Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think to your point around the macro environment in Europe and we all see the economic data coming out of Germany, would suggest that we are in fact seeing some slowdown in growth in Europe overall. Then, we've seen that as well across many of our businesses certainly seen it specifically in the short-cycle businesses. I'd say very much like we are seeing in the US, the long-cycle businesses continue to perform well in Europe. So Electrical Systems and Services and data centers, specifically in Europe, Aerospace, obviously the global industry is doing well. And so I think, we've seen, I could perhaps on an accentuated basis, more or less the continuation of the same trends that we're seeing globally. But no question, Europe is a bit weaker. It's a bit weaker when you think about industrial markets and industrial controls and the like. But it's all incorporated in our guidance and we think that Europe essentially is not going to be terribly different than what we assumed when we put our profit plan together.Jeffrey D. Hammond -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Thanks, guys.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next questions comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.Andrew Obin -- BAML -- AnalystYes, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerHi.Andrew Obin -- BAML -- AnalystJust a question on China. Can you talk about sort of China progression during the quarter? Frankly, I would have expected Mobile China Hydraulics to be a bigger positive. So I was just surprised that they didn't move the needle as much. And if you can give us any color as to how April is developing in China. Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I will say to your point, I mean China started off the year quite weak in January, and March was a much better month. And we see that and certainly the GDP data and the IP data specifically coming out of China. Even automotive markets were relatively speaking, stronger in the month of March than they were in the first two months of the year. And so I'd say a lot of the economic stimulus that the Chinese government is putting into place are early indicators, but it would suggest that it is having the desired impact. And so we think China probably continues to strengthen from this point forward.Eaton overall, revenues actually grew in Q1 in China as a company. So it was -- despite the fact that we had some weakness in automotive markets, we actually saw strong mid-single digit growth in China, specifically. And to your point, yeah, the Hydraulics, the excavator market was quite strong, up some 24%, I believe in Q1. It's an important market for us, but it's obviously not big enough to move the needle, given some of the offsets in other regions and other segments that are part of that business. But we do think China improves as we look forward.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerAnd Andrew if you look at some of the construction metrics in China, they were pretty positive in Q1 and got more positive as the quarter went on. So offer starts are up I think 18% and residential starts were up 12%. So you are seeing a lot of the stimulus in China start flowing into somebody's construction-related markets.Andrew Obin -- BAML -- AnalystAnd just the second question, you definitely highlighted strength in oil and gas. Can you give us more color sort of upstream, midstream, downstream and maybe some color, what specifically you're seeing at (inaudible). Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. No, I'd say we talked about -- we're definitely seeing strength in oil and gas. And we think our business in the oil and gas, that we had a good first quarter of revenue, a good first quarter of orders and we think in the market in 2019 kind of grows mid-to-high single-digits. And then there as a company, we play more downstream than we do upstream, and so we are more exposed to that piece of the market. But we do think you saw the rig count is up somewhat 9% or so in Q1. And so we do think oil and gas continues to strengthen. And that's what we're seeing in our business as well.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerAnd we're benefiting from some of these large downstream projects. For example, some of these LNG facilities that are being configured now and petrochemical, and so we're definitely more slanted toward downstream type applications.Andrew Obin -- BAML -- AnalystAnd how fast does it hit your backlog that oil price moves? Do you see it immediately or is there a lag?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say there's generally a lag. I mean we've got -- I have not studied that question in a lot of detail, Andrew. But there's clearly a lag from the move in oil price to them putting in place, capacity to increase drilling or exploration and certainly given the fact that we're downstream, and the LIBOR probably will even be bigger for us than it would be for companies who are more exposed on the upstream side.Andrew Obin -- BAML -- AnalystPerfect. Thank you so much.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsNext question is from Deane Dray with RBC.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you. Good morning, everyone.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerHi.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHi, Deane.Hey, maybe just touch on some of the variables in the quarter broadly that the number of the other industrial companies have called out as either a factor or not a factor. So I didn't hear anything particular about weather. Was -- did that come into play? And you talked about the inventory adjustments. Did any that -- you see any of your business experience a pull-in out of the first quarter into the fourth quarter last year, and might that have been a factor this quarter?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd I'd say, Deane, we try to stay away from those kind of tangential elements around weather and the light because it's really difficult to ascertain how that impacted your business. And so at this point, I'd say that, was weather an impact in Q1, it could have been; was it big enough to fundamentally change the outlook or kind of the thesis on the year, I'd say probably not. And to the point around pull-ins, we really didn't see over any material pull-ins as well at the end of, let's say Q4, that would have impacted our Q1 business. And so really none of these extraneous variables, I'd say would have had a material impact on the results in Q1.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThat's fair. And did you say how April started?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, we didn't. But I'd say very much in line with the guidance that we just provided for Q2. We'd expect 4% growth and I'd say that what you're going to likely continue to see is that our long-cycle businesses Electrical Systems and Services and Aerospace and Electrical Products will continue to perform very well and as we mentioned, part of the reason why we've taken the guidance down in the short cycle business. So once again, I think the Company's revenue story is really playing out very much like we anticipated, perhaps with more extremes, with more strength in the long-cycle stuff offsetting perhaps a bit of weakness in the short-cycle businesses.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerOkay.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystThanks, Craig. Good morning everybody.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystI apologize to beat a dead horse a little bit here. But on the Hydraulics margin decline and the reduced margin outlook, is some of that specifically the Q1 compression, is some of that related to accelerated restructuring?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, no, I'd say that not really, Andy. I mean we obviously are continuing to do restructuring in our business in Hydraulics and so I'd say, the margin compression really is largely a function of volume as we articulated earlier, and not because we're doing significantly more restructuring in the business. Now I won't say, a lot of focus obviously in Hydraulics and we certainly understand why at the end of the day, Hydraulics as a segment, accounts for less than 10% of our profits. And so, I think we have a really strong story in a lot of our other businesses that are just performing extraordinarily well and more than making up, quite frankly, for the little bit of a shortfall that we're having in Hydraulics business. But no, it's really not restructuring, it's really more volume and decrementals on the change in volume.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay. Thanks, Craig. And then within Electrical Products, we highlighted some strength in residential, which a little bit surprising given some of the macro data that we've been seeing. Is that share gains or what are you seeing there?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean resi for us, it was really a standout performer, quite frankly, in Q1 where we saw strong revenue growth and strong order growth and we think that -- largely we do think this is essentially this factor of as you move to higher valued electrical equipment with AFCIs and ground fault and the regulations and the codes that are driving standards, are certainly helping that business. But by and large, just as you know, housing prices are up. We're seeing a lot of remodels that that don't show up necessarily in the housing start data, but we continue to be quite bullish on resi and that's certainly played out in Q1.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerWe -- based on the data, we believe we have taken some care, but the market overall for resi electrical equipment is pretty strong. That's what the mean data would show. And our belief is that, that is likely to last throughout this year.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe think resi construction is up, our business taking up mid-to-high single digits for the year. So it's really a source of strength we think for the Company.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystOkay, thank you very much.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystHi, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, John.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystI guess, maybe a question on the margin. Can you talk a little bit about how the price versus commodity inflation, I guess, tariff bucket performed in the quarter and how you're thinking about that cadence for the balance of the year?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah. Thank you. Appreciate the question. I mean, certainly as we said in the past and Q1 played out that way and we think the year as well is that we think price versus cost we think will be largely neutral for the Company. Commodity prices as you've probably all certainly noted have abated a little bit and the copper probably is the one holdout where copper prices are still running at relatively high levels, but most of the other commodities that are important to the Company, we've seen commodity costs reduce, and so obviously, that's a good thing for the Company. But also as we think about price and cost being kind of natural offsets for each other, less inflation we see, the less price we see though. The less tariff-driven cost increases that we see, we obviously can't pass that price in the marketplace. So we're very comfortable for 2019 that pricing cost will be largely neutral, very much like our guidance has been.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat. And then maybe one more way to attack the negotiations comment. It doesn't sound like you want to give the absolute number, but is there a way to give it as a multiple of revenue in the business just to kind of frame the size a little bit more?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe size of negotiations as a percentage of revenue?John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystYeah, or the absolute number. I mean a couple of people have attacked it around what the 56% increase means year-on-year. Just...Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say for us, I mean -- we'd really like not to give you a number, but I would tell you that it is a big enough number to give confidence and to be indicative of what the future of the business looks like. It is a very large, very material number.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat, thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystHi, thanks for squeezing me. And maybe just a question around the short-cycle businesses, particularly Vehicle and Hydraulics. Worsening revenue outlook in both versus your prior guide, but you sound intensely relaxed about the cost outlook. I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around cost reduction in both businesses in the face of the worst top-line outlook. And then on Vehicle, it may just be something smaller or something in the mix, but I think you had a sort of low double-digit decremental margin in Q1. The guide for the year implies maybe a 30% decremental for the year as a whole. So is there something changing in terms of mix or what have you later in the year?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I mean maybe to address your first question first Julian, I mean I don't want to leave the wrong impression for a minute. To the extent that we have revenue shortfalls in any of our businesses, I can promise you that nobody is relaxed. Both our Vehicle business and our Hydraulics business is doing everything that they can. And in many cases more to flex the variable side of our cost, it's one of the key metrics that we track all of our businesses on, in terms of -- to the extent that they're flexing their cost down with changes and volume,but I'd say for us that's table stakes. That's something that we expect of every business that we do every day. So it's not the kind of thing that say, we spent a lot of time talking about.We don't -- the changes that we're talking about and revenue are not big enough to drive material changes in our restructuring plans, although in the event that the world changed dramatically, we would have the ability to do that. And so I can promise you nobody is in any way relaxed about ensuring that we're managing costs inside of our business.And then with respect to the decrementals in vehicle, yeah, very strong decremental performance in Q1. The decrementals in -- for the balance of the year, perhaps a little bigger than that, but still well below what we would call as a normal decremental for our Vehicle business. And so once again, rest assured that our Vehicle team is on their game. They do a great job, always have, are managing costs in the face of a downturn. And so you can count on them continuing to deliver.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystThat's very helpful. And then my second question would just be around any interesting trends you'd call out in terms of inventory levels at OEMs or channel partners across the businesses? How do you feel about absolute inventory levels as they sit today and has there been any change in recent weeks or months?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, if you are maybe taking the channel first, because that's kind of where you typically would see the big changes. And I'd say by and large not. Inventory today with our distributor partners are largely in line with where they've been historically and in line with their own outlook for revenue growth. And so we've really not seen any material change there at all. As I mentioned on the call, perhaps where we have seen some adjustments, is on the OEM side and some of the short-cycle businesses. But other than that, really inventories are very well managed.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystVery helpful. Thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsAt this point of the time, I will take the last question from Mig Dobre with Baird.Mig Dobre -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in and I want to go back to a question that's been asked before on Vehicle. So looking at this change in organic growth guidance, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but when you issued this guidance, I think we -- pretty much everybody knew some of the challenges that existed in the light vehicle space in terms of builds for the year. So trying to figure out what changed in your mind that prompted this guidance reduction? Is it really more driven by what's been happening with the JV? Is it shifts to eMobility or how do we think about this move?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, I'd say it's what -- really what we said, it's light vehicle markets around the world as I think is evidenced by Q1, have come in weaker at least than what we anticipated and I think in general, weaker than what most economic forecasters have anticipated. It has absolutely nothing to do with what's going on today inside of the commercial vehicle market. North America Class 8 truck continues to do just fine. The JV revenues, as I mentioned are growing nicely and certainly we've anticipated at the beginning of the year that there would be some transfer of revenue and that's largely on track. And this change really is a function of what we're seeing today, like global vehicle markets around the world now. We'll have to see what the rest of the year brings, but certainly the Q1 weakness really in all three regions of the world is really what influenced largely our changing guidance for the year.Mig Dobre -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystI see. Given the adjustment that you had to make the margin and the fact that margins are now going to be slightly lower year-over-year, as we look toward 2020 and we know the challenges that the commercial vehicle side of the business is going to have, is it fair for all of us to be thinking that margins will once again take a step down in 2020?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, I'd say not. I mean, as you know, we've done a lot of work over the last number of years to really build the business inside of our Vehicle business that essentially delivers strong margins through the cycle. And certainly as we -- as you know, because we have the joint venture, a lot of that volatility that used to sit inside of our business in our portfolio is no longer there. We've done a lot of restructuring and so I would say, you should not expect this business to take a material change at all in profitability even with, let's say, North America Class 8 market that's down significantly from where it is this year.Mig Dobre -- Robert W. Baird -- AnalystAll right, thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsOkay, good. Thank you. We have reached the end of our call and we do appreciate Donald (ph) for his presence. As always, Craig and I will be available to address all your questions today and do something the following weeks.

        "What Is Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) Share Price Doing? – Simply Wall St News": "\n\n    \n\n      Let’s talk about the popular Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). The company’s shares\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n      led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks.\n\n      \n\n        \n        \n          As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock.\n\n          However, what if the stock is still a bargain?\n\n          Let’s take a look at Eaton’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\n        \n\n      \n\n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n        See our latest analysis for Eaton\n      \n\n\n\n    Is Eaton still cheap?\n  \n\n  \n\n      \n\n        According to my valuation model, Eaton seems to be fairly priced at around\n\n          \n\n            16.83% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Eaton today, you’d be paying a relatively\n\n            reasonable\n\n            price for it.\n\n            And if you believe the company’s true value is\n\n            $72.93,\n\n            there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value.\n\n\n          \n\n            So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Eaton’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on.

        "Don’t Ignore The Fact That This Insider Just Sold Some Shares In Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) – Simply Wall St News": " We’d be surprised if Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) shareholders haven’t noticed that the Independent Director, Deborah McCoy, recently sold US$238k worth of stock at US$79.18 per share. On the bright side, that sale was only-9.1% of their holding, so we doubt it’s very meaningful, on its own.    See our latest analysis for Eaton    The Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer, Richard Fearon, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.5m worth of shares at a price of US$80.25 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$79.17. While we don’t usually like to see insider selling, it’s more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.  In the last twelve months insiders purchased 2285 shares for US$180k. But they sold 133k for US$11m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Eaton than they bought, over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!  Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that Eaton insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$87m. This level of insider ownership is good but just short of being particularly stand-out. It certainly does suggest a reasonable degree of alignment.  An insider sold stock recently, but they haven’t been buying. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn’t give us much comfort. Insider ownership isn’t particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We’d think twice before buying! If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.  But note: Eaton may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.   For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "What Kind Of Shareholders Own Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN)? – Simply Wall St News": " Every investor in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Institutions will often hold stock in bigger companies, and we expect to see insiders owning a noticeable percentage of the smaller ones. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.  Eaton has a market capitalization of US$35b, so it’s too big to fly under the radar. We’d expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. In the chart below below, we can see that institutional investors have bought into the company. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about ETN.  See our latest analysis for Eaton  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.  Eaton already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own 82% of the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can’t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there’s always a risk that they are in a ‘crowded trade’. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Eaton’s historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there’s always more to the story.  Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Eaton. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.  While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.  I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.  Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Eaton Corporation plc. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$89m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.   The general public holds a 18% stake in ETN. While this group can’t necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.  While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.  I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can find historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.  But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

        "Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Goes Ex": "Yahoo Finance is the exclusive host of the live streamEaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 3 days. Investors can purchase shares before the 1st of August in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of August.Eaton's next dividend payment will be US$0.71 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.84 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Eaton stock has a trailing yield of around 3.5% on the current share price of $81.57. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Eaton can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow.  See our latest analysis for Eaton  If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Eaton is paying out an acceptable 53% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 51% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click  here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Eaton, with earnings per share up 5.2% on average over the last five years. While earnings have been growing at a credible rate, the company is paying out a majority of its earnings to shareholders. Therefore it's unlikely that the company will be able to reinvest heavily in its business, which could presage slower growth in the future.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Eaton has lifted its dividend by approximately 11% a year on average. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders.Has Eaton got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have been growing modestly and Eaton paid out a bit over half of its earnings and free cash flow last year. While it does have some good things going for it, we're a bit ambivalent and it would take more to convince us of Eaton's dividend merits.Wondering what the future holds for Eaton? See what the 20 analysts we track are forecasting,  with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow We wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see, though. Here's  a list of interesting dividend stocks with a greater than 2% yield and an upcoming dividend. We aim to bring you long-term focused research analysis driven by fundamental data.

        "How Many Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Shares Do Institutions Own?": "Yahoo Finance is the exclusive host of the live streamThe big shareholder groups in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) have power over the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.Eaton has a market capitalization of US$35b, so it's too big to fly under the radar. We'd expect to see both institutions and retail investors owning a portion of the company. Taking a look at our data on the ownership groups (below), it's seems that institutions own shares in the company. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about ETN.  Check out our latest analysis for Eaton  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that Eaton does have institutional investors; and they hold 82% of the stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Eaton's earnings history, below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Eaton. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board; and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board, themselves.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Eaton Corporation plc insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amount to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$91m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. The general public, with a 18% stake in the company, will not easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.

        "Eaton Acquires Innovative Switchgear Solutions ": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Power management company Eaton (NYSE:ETN) today announced it has completed the acquisition of Innovative Switchgear Solutions, Inc.

        "Eaton (NYSE:ETN) Shareholders Have Enjoyed A 14% Share Price Gain": "Yahoo Finance is the exclusive host of the live streamLow-cost index funds make it easy to achieve average market returns. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. Unfortunately for shareholders, while the Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) share price is up 14% in the last three years, that falls short of the market return. Unfortunately, the share price has fallen 6.2% over twelve months.  Check out our latest analysis for Eaton  While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Eaton was able to grow its EPS at 8.3% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 4.4% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).We like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Eaton's earnings, revenue and cash flow.When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Eaton, it has a TSR of 26% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.While the broader market lost about 1.1% in the twelve months, Eaton shareholders did even worse, losing 2.8% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 5.4%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. Investors who like to make money usually check up on insider purchases, such as the price paid, and total amount bought. You can find out about the insider purchases of Eaton by clicking this link. There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.We aim to bring you long-term focused research analysis driven by fundamental data.

        "Is Eaton Corporation plc (ETN) A Good Stock To Buy?": "Yahoo Finance is the exclusive host of the live streamBefore we spend countless hours researching a company, we like to analyze what insiders, hedge funds and billionaire investors think of the stock first. This is a necessary first step in our investment process because our research has shown that the elite investors' consensus returns have been exceptional. In the following paragraphs, we find out what the billionaire investors and hedge funds think of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN).Is Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) the right investment to pursue these days? The best stock pickers are turning less bullish. The number of bullish hedge fund bets went down by 5 lately. Our calculations also showed that ETN isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q3 rankings and see the video below for Q2 rankings). ETN was in 31 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of September. There were 36 hedge funds in our database with ETN positions at the end of the previous quarter.  Video: Click the image to watch our video about the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks.According to most stock holders, hedge funds are perceived as slow, old financial vehicles of the past. While there are over 8000 funds in operation at the moment, Our researchers hone in on the masters of this club, around 750 funds. These money managers manage the majority of all hedge funds' total asset base, and by tracking their finest picks, Insider Monkey has unsheathed a few investment strategies that have historically outperformed Mr. Market. Insider Monkey's flagship short hedge fund strategy exceeded the S&P 500 short ETFs by around 20 percentage points per year since its inception in May 2014. Our portfolio of short stocks lost 27.8% since February 2017 (through November 21st) even though the market was up more than 39% during the same period. We just shared a list of 7 short targets in our latest quarterly update .[caption id=\"attachment_26092\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"482\"] Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Asset Management[/caption]Unlike the largest US hedge funds that are convinced Dow will soar past 40,000 or the world's most bearish hedge fund that's more convinced than ever that a crash is coming, our long-short investment strategy doesn't rely on bull or bear markets to deliver double digit returns. We only rely on the best performing hedge funds' buy/sell signals. We're going to check out the latest hedge fund action encompassing Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN).Heading into the fourth quarter of 2019, a total of 31 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of -14% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in ETN over the last 17 quarters. So, let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves.When looking at the institutional investors followed by Insider Monkey, AQR Capital Management, managed by Cliff Asness, holds the biggest position in Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN). AQR Capital Management has a $287.8 million position in the stock, comprising 0.3% of its 13F portfolio. The second most bullish fund manager is D E Shaw, led by David E. Shaw, holding a $29.5 million position; the fund has less than 0.1%% of its 13F portfolio invested in the stock. Remaining members of the smart money with similar optimism consist of Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management, Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital and David Harding's Winton Capital Management. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Prospector Partners allocated the biggest weight to Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), around 1.13% of its portfolio. Ancora Advisors is also relatively very bullish on the stock, earmarking 0.6 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to ETN.Because Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) has faced declining sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, logic holds that there was a specific group of funds that decided to sell off their entire stakes heading into Q4. Intriguingly, Brandon Haley's Holocene Advisors dropped the biggest stake of all the hedgies followed by Insider Monkey, comprising about $58.4 million in stock, and Clint Carlson's Carlson Capital was right behind this move, as the fund sold off about $16.7 million worth. These transactions are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 5 funds heading into Q4.Let's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (NYSE:BBVA), Humana Inc (NYSE:HUM), Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM), and Energy Transfer L.P. (NYSE:ET). This group of stocks' market values resemble ETN's market value.[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position BBVA,9,275548,2 HUM,61,3527353,-1 YUM,35,842106,5 ET,30,623109,1 Average,33.75,1317029,1.75 [/table]View table here if you experience formatting issues.As you can see these stocks had an average of 33.75 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $1317 million. That figure was $464 million in ETN's case. Humana Inc (NYSE:HUM) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (NYSE:BBVA) is the least popular one with only 9 bullish hedge fund positions. Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 37.4% in 2019 through the end of November and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 9.9 percentage points. A small number of hedge funds were also right about betting on ETN as the stock returned 12.1% during the first two months of Q4 and outperformed the market by an even larger margin.Disclosure: None.

Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude charges of $0.08 per share for acquisition and divestiture transaction and integration costs, were $1.52. This represents an increase of 6 percent over the third quarter of 2018, excluding the 2018 arbitration decision related to the legacy Cooper business.\n\nSales in the third quarter of 2019 were $5.3 billion, down 2 percent from the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were down 1 percent and negative currency translation was 1½ percent, partially offset by the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear, which added ½ percent to sales.\n\nCraig Arnold, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer, said, “We had a solid third quarter, with adjusted earnings per share up 6 percent over 2018 excluding the 2018 arbitration decision, despite market growth coming in significantly lower than our expectations. Our organic sales growth was down 1 percent. As we began the quarter, we expected organic sales would be up 3 percent. Our adjusted segment margins in the third quarter were 18.7 percent, an all-time record and above the high end of our guidance. This represents a 110 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2018. We had all-time record margins in three of our segments - - Electrical Products, Electrical Systems and Services, and Aerospace. Together, these three segments represent nearly 80 percent of our segment operating profits.\n\n“Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $1.1 billion, a new quarterly record. We now expect full year 2019 operating cash flow to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion, $100 million above our prior guidance. This reflects a cash conversion ratio above 120 percent,” said Arnold. “We continued to return substantial cash to our shareholders in the quarter, repurchasing $539 million of our shares, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to a total of $949 million, or 2.8 percent of the shares outstanding at the start of 2019.\n\n“For full year 2019, we now expect organic sales to grow 1 percent, compared to our previous estimate of 3 percent, and we estimate the impact of negative currency translation to be $350 million, $50 million higher than our previous expectation. As a result, we now expect 2019 adjusted earnings per share to be between $5.67 and $5.77, down at the midpoint 9 cents from consensus, and representing a 6 percent increase over 2018, excluding the 2018 arbitration decision,” said Arnold. “Accordingly, for the fourth quarter of 2019, we anticipate adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.36 and $1.46.”\n\nBusiness Segment Results\n\nSales for the Electrical Products segment were $1.8 billion, flat with the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were up 1 percent, offset by negative currency translation of 1 percent. Operating profits were $358 million. Excluding $4 million of transaction costs related to the divestiture of the Lighting business, adjusted operating profits were $362 million, up 6 percent over the third quarter of 2018.\n\n“Operating margins in the third quarter were 20.0 percent,” said Arnold. “Excluding costs related to the divestiture of the Lighting business, adjusted operating margins were 20.3 percent, up 110 basis points over 2018 and an all-time quarterly record.\n\n“In mid-October, we signed an agreement to sell our lighting business to Signify for a price of $1.4 billion,” said Arnold. “We believe this is a good outcome for our employees and shareholders.\n\n“Orders in the third quarter, excluding Lighting, were up 1 percent, with growth strongest in residential and commercial construction markets in the Americas,” said Arnold.\n\nSales for the Electrical Systems and Services segment were $1.6 billion, up 3 percent over the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were up 3 percent and the acquisition of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear added 1½ percent to sales, which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 1½ percent. Operating profits were $284 million. Excluding transaction and acquisition integration costs of $3 million related to Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear, adjusted operating profits were $287 million, up 23 percent over the third quarter of 2018.\n\n“Operating margins were 18.1 percent. Excluding transaction and acquisition integration costs, adjusted operating margins were 18.3 percent, an improvement of 290 basis points over 2018 and an all-time record,” said Arnold. “The twelve-month rolling average of our orders in the third quarter was up 5 percent, with growth across all regions. Excluding hyperscale data center orders, which are sometimes lumpy due to customers placing orders for multiple years in a single quarter, the twelve-month rolling average of our orders in the third quarter was up 8 percent, the same as in the second quarter.”\n\nHydraulics segment sales were $603 million, down 10 percent from the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were down 8 percent and negative currency translation was 2 percent. Revenue declined due to weakness in the global mobile equipment market and destocking at both OEMs and distributors.

Operating profits in the third quarter were $139 million, down 16 percent from the third quarter of 2018.\n\n“Operating margins in the quarter were 18.3 percent,” said Arnold. “Our revenue in Vehicle declined due to global weakness in light vehicle markets, as well as revenues that transferred over to the Eaton Cummins joint venture.”\n\neMobility segment sales were $79 million, down 1 percent from the third quarter of 2018. Organic sales were flat and negative currency translation was 1 percent. Operating profits in the third quarter were $4 million, down 60 percent from the third quarter of 2018 due to increased investment in research and development.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nThis earnings release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. These financial measures include adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per ordinary share, and operating profit before acquisition integration and divestiture charges for each business segment as well as corporate, each of which differs from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). A reconciliation of each of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in this earnings release. Management believes that these financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude certain transactions, allowing investors to more easily compare Eaton Corporation plc's (Eaton or the Company) financial performance period to period. Management uses this information in monitoring and evaluating the on-going performance of Eaton and each business segment.\n\nNet income per ordinary share of $4.91 for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5.39 excluding the $0.48 per share expense from an arbitration decision related to the legacy Cooper Industries business acquired in 2012.

        "Was Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) Earnings Growth Better Than The Industry’s? – Simply Wall St News": " Assessing Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) past track record of performance is a useful exercise for investors. It allows us to understand whether the company has met or exceed expectations, which is a great indicator for future performance. Below, I assess ETN’s latest performance announced on 30 September 2019 and evaluate these figures to its historical trend and industry movements.  View our latest analysis for Eaton ETN’s trailing twelve-month earnings (from 30 September 2019) of US$2.4b has jumped 11% compared to the previous year.  Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has exceeded its 5-year annual growth average of 7.0%, indicating the rate at which ETN is growing has accelerated. What’s the driver of this growth? Let’s take a look at whether it is solely due to industry tailwinds, or if Eaton has experienced some company-specific growth.  In terms of returns from investment, Eaton has fallen short of achieving a 20% return on equity (ROE), recording 15% instead. However, its return on assets (ROA) of 8.3% exceeds the US Electrical industry of 7.9%, indicating Eaton has used its assets more efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Eaton’s debt level, has increased over the past 3 years from 8.8% to 11%. This correlates with a decrease in debt holding, with debt-to-equity ratio declining from 54% to 51% over the past 5 years.  Though Eaton’s past data is helpful, it is only one aspect of my investment thesis. Positive growth and profitability are what investors like to see in a company’s track record, but how do we properly assess sustainability? I recommend you continue to research Eaton to get a better picture of the stock by looking at: NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the trailing twelve months from 30 September 2019.

        "Is Eaton Corporation plc’s (NYSE:ETN) CEO Paid Enough Relative To Peers? – Simply Wall St News": " The CEO of Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is Craig Arnold. This analysis aims first to contrast CEO compensation with other large companies. Next, we’ll consider growth that the business demonstrates. And finally – as a second measure of performance – we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels.  View our latest analysis for Eaton  Our data indicates that Eaton Corporation plc is worth US$38b, and total annual CEO compensation was reported as US$15m for the year to December 2018. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.2m. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$11m. There aren’t very many mega-cap companies, so we had to take a wide range to get a meaningful comparison figure.  As you can see, Craig Arnold is paid more than the median CEO pay at large companies, in the same market. However, this does not necessarily mean Eaton Corporation plc is paying too much. We can better assess whether the pay is overly generous by looking into the underlying business performance.  You can see, below, how CEO compensation at Eaton has changed over time.  Over the last three years Eaton Corporation plc has grown its earnings per share (EPS) by an average of 6.3% per year (using a line of best fit). It achieved revenue growth of 1.2% over the last year.  I would argue that the improvement in revenue isn’t particularly impressive, but the modest improvement in EPS is good. So there are some positives here, but not enough to earn high praise. Shareholders might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.  Most shareholders would probably be pleased with Eaton Corporation plc for providing a total return of 58% over three years. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.  We compared total CEO remuneration at Eaton Corporation plc with the amount paid at other large companies. Our data suggests that it pays above the median CEO pay within that group.  Over the last three years returns to investors have been great, though we might have liked stronger business growth. As a result of the juicy return to investors, the CEO remuneration may well be quite reasonable. Shareholders may want to check for free if Eaton insiders are buying or selling shares.  Arguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.

[Operator Instructions] I'll turn the call now over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Yan Jin. Please go ahead sir.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsGood morning. I am Yan Jin, Eaton's Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us for the Eaton Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO; and Richard Fearon, Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today including opening remarks by Craig, highlighting the Company's performance in the third quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of the Craig's comments.The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and the presentation we will go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the price release and the presentation includes reconciliations to the non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and it will be available for replay.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today including statements related to the expected the future results of the Company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and the presentation. They are also outlined in our related 8-K filing.With that I will turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks Yan. I appreciate it. We will start on Page three with a highlight of our Q3 results. Overall, I'd characterize this quarter's results as really strong earnings results and strong cash flow despite weaker end markets. Earnings per share as you saw in the press release were $1.44 in GAAP basis, $1.52 excluding transaction costs and acquisition and divestiture in excess of our businesses, $1.52 our results were 6% above last year excluding the 2018 arbitration decision and within our guidance range of 1.52 [Phonetic] to 160. However, sales were certainly lower than what we expected, down 1% organically. Negative currency impacting us by 1.5 [Phonetic] and acquisitions adding 0.5 [Phonetic] point to our results. We continue to deliver strong margin performance with another record in all-time earnings on margins.Segment operating margins of 18.7% for an all-time record for Eaton and this includes records for Electrical products, for Electrical Systems and Services, and for Aerospace. These margins were also above the high end of our guidance and 110 basis points above last year. We continue to generate very strong operating cash flows of $1.1 billion, up 8% over Q3 2018 and an another quarterly record.Lastly with summarizing results, where we purchased 539 million shares in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date purchases to $949 million or 2.8% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.Turning to Page 4, we show a summary of our Q3 performance versus prior year and I'll just point out a few highlights here. First, we delivered $41 million of increase in segment operating profits despite a 1% decline in organic revenue and this was really driven by strong execution, effective cost control and favorable mix in a couple of our businesses. Second, we incurred $0.08 per share of after-tax cost, primarily related to the planned divestiture of our lighting business. And lastly, adjusted EPS increased 6% excluding the 2018 arbitration decision. These results. I'd say are consistent with our boarder message on how we intend to run the Company doing periods of market weakness, with strong execution, proactive cost control and increasing our share repurchases.On Page 5, we show our quarterly results for our Electrical Product segment. Overall revenues were flat, made up of 1% organic growth, offset by 1% negative currency. We saw revenue strength in both commercial and residential markets in North America, partially offset by softness in industrial controls globally. Segment operating profits increased 6% and operating margins were up 110 basis points to 20.3%, which was an all-time record for the segment.We also announced the sale of our lighting business to signify for price of $1.4 billion and we've seen a good outcome for our shareholders and another example of how we're actively managing the portfolio to create higher margin and higher growth set of businesses for Eaton. This was a decision that was also good for our employees, who will now be part of a larger and more focused lighting company. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020 and I'd say for our core products business which now excludes the lighting orders were up 1% led by strength in residential and commercial construction largely once again in the Americas.Moving to Page 6, we summarize our results for our Electrical Systems and Services segment. Revenues increased 3%, 3% organic growth. We also had a 1.5% growth from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions and a 1.5% of negative currency. Organic growth here was driven by strength in data centers, commercial construction and actually also in engineering services. Our ES&S business also produced all time record margins of 18.3% which were up 290 basis points from prior year. Operating profits increasing some 23% on 3% organic growth.This business benefited from higher sales for sure but also had very good operational execution and conversion. And on a rolling 12-month basis, ES&S orders were up 5% with growth really across I'd say all regions here and if you exclude hyperscale data centers, the 12-month rolling average of our orders was up 8% which was really in line with what we saw in Q2. So once again, a long-cycle business very much performing at a very high levels.On the next page, we show our results for Hydraulics for Q3. Revenues were down 10% with an 8% decline in organic revenues and 2% negative currency. Organic revenue declines were driven primarily by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in quite frankly destocking that we've seen both at the OEM level and also within distribution.Segment operating margins were 11.9%, down 290 basis from last year but I think on a sequential basis, margins were actually up 40 basis points despite seasonally lower Q3 revenues that came in about $100 million below Q2. And our order declined to 14% really as a result of continued weakness, as we mentioned in global mobile equipment markets around the world.Turning to Page 8, we summarized our quarterly results for Aerospace segment. Once again, this business posted very strong results with record top line and bottom line performance. Revenues increased 7% with 8% organic growth and 1% negative currency. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis increased 13% with particular strength in the military market, specifically for fighters, for watercraft and also aftermarket. We also saw strength on the commercial side in business jets. We continue to demonstrate strong incremental margins with nearly 60% growth in margins on organic revenues which drove over 23% increase in operating profits and a 310 basis point improvement in our margins. And as you recall, we announced the acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank in July and we expect this transaction to close before the end of the year. So all things are good in Aerospace.On the next page, we summarize our Q3 results for the Vehicle segment. Our revenues were down 13% which includes a 12% decline in organic revenues and a negative 1% impact from currency. The organic sales decline was due to a combination of global weakness in light vehicle markets which we think were down approximately 4% in the quarter and primarily the impact of the transfer revenues into the Eaton Cummins joint venture. For 2019, the NAFTA Class 8 market remains solid, we expect production to be roughly 340,000 units this year and up 5% for 2018. We do however expect global light vehicle market to be down some 4% for the year. Despite lower organic revenues and volume, operating margins continue to run at very high level at 18.3%, margins were down only 60 basis points from last year. So our vehicle team once again did a nice job of flexing spending which allow them to deliver a detrimental margins of approximately 25%.Moving to Page 10, we show our eMobility results for Q3. Revenues were down 1% with flat organic revenues and negative 1% from currency. Flat organic revenues in this case of due primarily to a mix of platforms that we're on, I'd ask you to keep in mind that in this business is really made up of a mix of the new electric and hybrid platforms plus the legacy electrical content that we have on internal combustion engines.Once again, we increased our R&D spending which was really the primary reason why operating margins declined 740 basis points to 5.1%, but we continue to pursue a large number of additional electric and hybrid programs here and we are very pleased with the progress that we're making to date.Next on Page 10, we summarized our outlook for 2019. We now expect organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and as you know this is down from our prior estimate of approximately 3% and this is really based upon reduced global growth, particularly in our short cycle businesses but also includes some slow growth in non-res construction as well. Still growth but slower growth which has impacted our Electrical business.Within Electrical, we now expect full-year organic growth of approximately 2.5% for electrical products and 4.5% for Electrical Systems and Services. Hydraulics global mobile equipment markets remain weak and this weakness is being amplified but really destocking in both the OEM and distribution channel. As a result, we now expect organic revenues to decline by approximately 4.5%. Aerospace remained strong across the board and we're reaffirming the midpoint of our full year growth estimate of 9.5%. In Vehicle, global automotive markets remain weak so we're reducing our organic revenue estimates to be down approximately 10% for the year. And we've also slightly modified our estimates for e-mobility as well which we think will be growth of 4% at the midpoint of 2019.Overall our long cycle businesses within ES&S and Aerospace are expected to continue to deliver attractive organic growth rates for the year, while we project low single-digit growth for electrical products overall. Business conditions have clearly been impacted by trade, by the political environment and a number of one-off events that have weakened our second half outlook, maybe as a kind of confidence as we look to the future, we'd say, what the fundamentals of the economy still solid, low interest rates. high employment, strong consumer confidence and we hope that is pulled back would be short-lived but we have to wait and see.Moving to Page 12, we show our margin expectations for the year and I think based upon the strong Q3 margins we're increasing our consolidated segment operating profit margin guidance 20 basis points to a new range of 17.3% to 17.7% or 17.5% at the midpoint. And this includes increasing margins for three of our six segments. Electrical Products up by 30 basis points, Electrical Systems and services up by 50 basis points, and Aerospace up by 120 basis points. And due to expected volume declines we're lowering margins in two of our segments: hydraulics by 110 basis points and Vehicle by 40 basis points. With this updated guidance, I'd say that we are really on track to deliver another record year of margins with a strong 70 basis point increase at the midpoint over 2018 despite lower revenues can we anticipated.And finally, turning to Page 13, we show our guidance for Q4 in 2019. For Q4 we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.36 to $1.46, other assumptions for Q4 in our guidance include, we think our organic revenues will decline by approximately 2%, we'd expect segment margins of 17.2% to 17.6%, flat corporate expenses of two last year and an adjusted earnings tax rate of approximately 17% we are slightly lowering the midpoint of our full year 2019 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.72, $0.09 below the current consensus and due to lower market conditions. This does still represent a 6% increase over 2018 when you exclude the impact of the arbitration decisions. We're also increasing our operating cash flow guidance by an another $100 million as you recall that we increased it by $200 million so far through this point and we now expect to deliver $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year, because I mentioned the second time that we will increase our operating cash flow guidance which highlight really the strong cash flow generation capability of our businesses.For 2019, our free cash flow to adjusted earnings conversion is expected to be over 120%, while free cash flow to sales is estimated to reach approximately 14%. Other full-year guidance assumptions include 1% organic growth, a $100 million of revenue from the acquisitions of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions, foreign exchange impact of a negative $350 million and this is actually $50 million worse than our prior guidance, segment margins in the range of 17.3% to 17.7%, up 20 basis points at the midpoint. No change in our tax rate, we think our capex spending this year will be roughly $550 million and this is about $50 million lower than prior guidance and we estimate for our share purchases to be increased to roughly $1 billion and this is up from our prior guidance of $800 million as we continue to deploy our strong free cash flow.So overall, we're very pleased with the Company's performance this year. We're delivering very strong cash flow, solid EPS growth despite what turned out to be a much weaker economic environment for many of our end markets. So I'll stop with that and turn it back over to Yan for Q&A.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsThanks, Craig. Before we begin the Q&A session for our call today, I do see we have a lot of individuals have interested in the queue with questions. Given the time constraint of one hour today and our desire to go to as many of the questions as possible, please limit your opportunity to just to one question and a follow-up. And I will thank you in the advance for your cooperation.With that I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instructions.OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay. We'll take the first question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Nigel.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystObviously lot of good detail on the call, you did a great job of adjusting to the trending conditions in 3Q showed us a very nice margin, you are assuming margin step down a bit more than normal seasonality in the 4Q. I'm just wondering what's driving that Craig I recon? Is there any additional restructuring coming through in 4Q and where we stands on additional restructuring actions in lights of that weaker volumes.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsI appreciate the question Nigel, I mean to your statement. Absolutely, if you think about kind of the bridge between Q3 and Q2, we're really outstanding performance in Q3 there were number of items that were impacting us in Q3 and Q4 that are taking the margins down, one is a higher level of restructuring and you could imagine, it's largely in those businesses where we're seeing additional market weakness. We certainly are seeing a higher tax rate in Q4 than we had in Q3 if you saw the operational tax rate of roughly 17%. In addition to that there is a few normal factors, healthcare cost tend to run higher in Q4 than in prior quarters. And so this is a number of, one-time items that we're dealing with in Q4. Obviously, we dealing with the GM strike that a little bit of an impact as well in Q4 that take the margins down, but I'd say that as you think about the outlook for 2020, I feel a lot of these are one-time items and I know that a number of the analysts wrote about extrapolating Q4 into next year, I guess I just ask you to keep in mind that there are a number of one-time and seasonal items that are impacting Q4 that you really would not be justified and and extrapolating for the full year.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThat's great color. We will dig into the details offline but I do want to switch to ESS margins and we probably 2 years ago thinking 15% and this business will be a dream and here at 18%. So I'm just curious, how confident we feel that you can defend this level of margin going forward? And maybe just address what's changed to drive such a high margin?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOnce again we agree, 18% is outstanding performance by our team in general. And as I mentioned in my commentary, it is a function of really strong execution by the organization on higher volumes that we saw in the quarter and we will clearly need to revisit the long-term margin guidance for our ES&S segment. If you recall, we talked about this segment performing at 13% to 16% through the cycle, we're already performing well above those numbers and so as we think about giving the outlook for the business and setting expectations, we do believe that this business will perform at higher levels on a go-forward basis.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks Craig.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOkay, good. Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc.Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc -- AnalystGood morning, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Jeff.Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc -- AnalystIf you can just talk about where we stand in the destocking for Hydraulics and are you seeing any destocking in Electrical? And maybe just speak through where in the guide you're seeing softness within, I guess particularly EPG.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think in terms of Hydraulics it seems as we talked about on our commentary, we've seen broad based destocking significant, let's say destocking at the OEM channel as productions continues to run well below retail sales and you see that in a lot of the public data in also in distribution we're seeing the same thing. I think the question becomes how long does this go on and that we could sit here and attempt to speculate when does the destocking and it's really going to be a function of what ultimately happens with the end markets and it indicated in the end market demand, I will say that today we take a little confidence in the fact that the end market demand in many of these hydraulic markets around the world are certainly performing OK and we're talking about, let's say, on average, low single-digit growth in a market like construction flagged to slightly down in markets like Ag [Phonetic] but what we are experiencing as a supplier it's our numbers at a much worse than that and so we take some confidence in that that we're are approaching the end but I think ultimately it will be really be a function of what's going to happen with these end markets in terms of destocking in Hydraulics business.In the Electrical business more broadly, at this point we're not really seeing significant destocking in Electrical and what kind of impacted our growth a little bit in Electrical in the quarter was largely project delays, given the kind of the uncertain political environment that we're living in right now, it has been really more of that issue then it's been an issue of destocking and certainly if you think about our Electrical Products business much of which goes through distribution in periods of uncertainty, they are kind of being cautious around the inventory levels that they are putting on the shelf in general but not at this point I'd say a significant amount of destocking.Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc -- AnalystOkay, great. And then Craig, I think in past years you provide kind of initial views on that year in third quarter and I didn't see anything in there. Anything you can give on how you're thinking about the markets, incrementals and non-operating items and kind of uses of cash around the the Lighting sales? Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean your observation is absolutely accurate, Jeff. We would typically in this call give kind of some insight into 2020, given the level of uncertainty in the environment that we're currently dealing with, whether it's trade or geopolitical or some of these one-off customer events, we thought it would be prudent at this juncture not to provide guidance for 2020, some of the Q4 play through. And we would then be providing guidance as a part of our earnings call in January and so that's kind of the way we're thinking about that. The specific question around uses of cash, obviously we will sell the Lighting business for $1.4 billion and it would be our intention to use those proceeds to buyback shares. We're going to attempt to be smart and strategic in the timing of the buyback program but the intention would be to use those proceeds, plus our very strong cash flow generating capabilities to make sure that we fully offset any dilution associated with the divestiture of Lighting.Jeff Hammond -- KeyBanc -- AnalystOkay. Thanks, Craig.OperatorOur next question come from Dave Raso with Evercore.Dave Raso -- Evercore -- AnalystGood morning. Apologize, I missed the very beginning of the call but for the Electrical businesses exiting 2019 into '20, the Lighting business is still officially in the guide for fourth quarter for EP, correct? Just to be clear?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes.Dave Raso -- Evercore -- AnalystOkay. So the orders were up 1% ex-lighting for ET and in ES&S orders. I'd say overall we're probably a little better than people feared but can you help us understand, what you're seeing beyond the quarter in the sense of, what's in the back half, further visibility, short the normal, just trying to get a sense of Electrical start the year healthy because obviously people are wondering can we get the more cyclical businesses bottoming out at some point in the first half and hope they're all growing together in the end of the year.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question, Dave. The business that obviously we have the greatest visibility within our Electrical Systems and Services business and I will say that our order input in Q3 was quite strong across the board. Most of the end markets that we serve, I'd say posted anywhere from mid to high single-digit order growth in the quarter which really bodes well I'd say for the long cycle piece of our business with Electrical Systems and Services into 2020, I think it's too early to make a call on it and that's one of the reasons why we're not providing guidance. But certainly if we take a look at the order book and what happened during the course of Q3 in Electrical Systems and Services, we feel very good about the order intake and how the 2020 is shaping up.And Electrical Products which tend to be much more of a book-and-bill business and as we mentioned, we did see a little bit of conservatism on the part of distribution, and in that business it just doesn't tend to be a longer cycle business and so we'll just have to see what happens with some of these other kind of world events and what level of distribution confidence we're taking in with us into 2020.Dave Raso -- Evercore -- AnalystAnd the ex-Lighting in the fourth quarter, or I should say it another way is Lighting down in the fourth quarter, so I assume that will be out of the business when we give the guide in January in the sense of core business?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWhen I say. I appreciate the question. Dave, given the fact that we've entered into a transaction and we signed and we would prefer not to comment on Lighting as it's going to ultimately be somebody else's business on a go-forward basis. And so as we think about Lighting on a go-forward basis and we would prefer not to comment on that business given the transactions and the fact that ultimately somebody else is going to own it.Dave Raso -- Evercore -- AnalystI can appreciate that. Okay, thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius.Scott Davis -- Melius -- AnalystGood morning guys.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHi.Scott Davis -- Melius -- AnalystCraig, Just to kind of address the elephant in the room when you have quarters like this, where you missed your guidance on the top line which doesn't happen to this extreme very often, does it make you kind of rethink the portfolio a little bit? I mean you got Hydraulics and vehicle that will actually goes around every cycle and is it worth the headaches, I mean I'll just leave it at that.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question, Scott. And as we've talked on this call before we would like to, I'd say laid out our criteria for businesses that we like and the conditions under which we think we're going to stay in business and the conditions in which we're going to step out and I will say that if you take a look at our track record over time Eaton has done a lot of work around the portfolio and the Lighting divestiture is the latest example of that. At the end of the day, you think about today hydraulics and the quarter delivered 7% of our company profit facility, at the end of the day whether Hydraulics grows 5% or shrinks 5%, it really doesn't have a significant impact on the ultimate earnings of our company. So we like to think that we're getting some of the execution issues behind us and it is a cyclical business, it will always be a cyclical business, but at the end of the day what really drives Eaton, as we said on the earnings call 80% of our earnings come from Electrical Systems & Services, electrical products in Aerospace and that's really what drives the company.And we will continue to work on our internal plans to improve the execution of Hydraulics, they know what they need to do in order to continue to deliver and be a value creating part of the Company. So I'd say at this point we're comfortable with the portfolio and at the end of day will continue to focus on the things that we can control and side of the business, recognizing it these will always be cyclical businesses.Scott Davis -- Melius -- AnalystFair enough, Craig. And just as a follow-up, I mean I know you mentioned that you've got this billion dollars coming in and you're going to do more buybacks, but is this types of environment or you want to take another more aggressive look at M&A or is this the type of environment, or it's so uncertain that it's better to push it to the right there.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe always look at the trade-off. We've been very disciplined over the years around in terms of understanding what our cost of capital is and we think it's roughly 8% to 9%, and we'd expect to return order magnitude to 200 to 300 basis points over, our cost of capital as a minimum. And so we've been a very disciplined buyer through both at a low point in the economic cycle and we would continue to maintain that and that's the way we'll run the company.And so for us, it's always going to be a matter of trading off what an acquisition would do for the company in both strategically and in terms of EPS versus the option that we have of buying back shares at very attractive prices.Scott Davis -- Melius -- AnalystOkay, good enough. Thanks. Good luck, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystI wanted to go back to the Aerospace margins, obviously very strong. I know a couple of quarters ago, we had a conversation around OE versus aftermarket mix but similar to that ESS line of questioning, we are above kind of your through the cycle look on that business, how do you view the sustainability of those really strong Aerospace margins?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question and I'd say as I've said on prior calls, this is really been a little bit of a Goldilocks period for the Aerospace industry overall because you have really strong market demand, you have a very strong aftermarket and you have relatively by historical standards low program spending. And so you're seeing the result of that deliver very strong margins but that is certainly another one of the segments that we're going to clearly have to take a look at as we provide once again our longer-term outlook for the business in terms of what margin should look like through the cycle. And clearly that's one that will be revisiting and will likely go up, given the levels of the business is performing at today.But I'd say today when we think about whether or not 25% margins are pretty extraordinary and the business probably won't perform at that level every quarter but I will say that we're very comfortable today that the margins in this business will perform at very high levels and very attractive levels for some time to come and primarily because consumers are continuing to get on planes and that drives the aftermarket. The military business is really just kicking into gear right now and and Boeing and Airbus are sitting on very large backlog and so we think this business will be good for a very long time.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat, thank you for that. And then obviously there has been a lot of questions around capital allocation addition In the strong cash, it's going to be coming in the door. I know you don't want to get ahead of yourself for next year but you've historically had this expectation to take down 1% to 2% of float next year. I mean, should we assume that the high end of, that's kind of where we should be base casing it?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerYes, it's. Rick, I would think of it this way, Our expectation would be take down 1% to 2% float and then the proceeds from Lighting on top of that, so you'll end up with considerably more than 1% to 2%.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat, thank you for that.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd this is an important point because one of the things that we committed to you and the investor community in general is that as we think about how we would manage the company during periods of market weakness is that we said that we would use our strong cash flow generation capabilities in our balance sheet to essentially buyback shares to help offset pressures in terms of EPS and that's clearly what we did in Q3. And you could expect that as we look into 2020 depending upon where markets end up, that will continue to kind of run the same play.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystThanks. Good morning guys. And maybe just the first question around the increase in the operating cash flow guidance, I guess, key drivers of the that it looks like the receivables balance is down inventories up a little bit, so just trying to reconcile where that's coming from?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerYou're right. Working capital was very strong. If you look at the combination of receivables and payables, the change from Q2 to Q3, you're just shy of $200 million and so we have done a good job all year at managing working capital, we expect that to continue into Q4 and already our initial thinking about next year would have further improvements as a variety of programs relating to for example correcting any billing inaccuracies that makes a big difference on receivables, but also in payables and making sure that we are paying our suppliers in a commercially reasonable time-frame and we believe we have further opportunities to improve both receivables and payables.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd to your point, Nicole. Inventory is actually are up slightly. When you're facing into an economic downturn, we typically take inventories out of the organization so we quite frankly have a big opportunity still on in front of us in terms of really reducing our overall inventory levels and so to Rick's point we would expect 2020 to be another year of very strong cash flow.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystThanks, Craig. You actually just pre-answered my second question any thoughts on the monthly progression of organic growth throughout the quarter? Things are getting a lot worse for you guys in September and then I guess anything initial that you have to say on October relative to the guidance that you've provided today for the fourth quarter?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOne of the thing that was out at the Investor Conference Nicole and Laguna, and it's been kind of indicated there that we have already seen really in the first couple of months of the quarter, some market weakness,which really I'd say persisted throughout the quarter. So if I say no, not particularly, September wasn't particularly weaker month than the other two months in the quarter in terms of the progression and how it unfolds. And in terms of October, I'd say, what we've seen so far is largely consistent with the forecast that we have provided.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystThanks, I'll pass it on.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThanks, good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Joe.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystSo, Craig, I wanted to touch on the just the disconnect between what you're seeing on the order growth side on ESS and what you're expecting from a growth perspective and you mentioned in your prepared comments project deferrals and so I'd love to get a little bit more color on where you're actually seeing project deferrals and how that kind of plays out into 2020?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes and what you referred to as a disconnect, I would say largely, if you think about the Electrical Systems and Services business, it does tend to be a longer cycle business. And probably the best proxy for what we would expect for that business in fourth quarter, probably would have been orders that we have received in Q2 of 2019 and if you recall, we had a relatively weak order intake in Q2. So there is a time lag to that business but once again to your point, we did see very strong orders in Q3 and we think that does bode well for 2020. And so that's really the way I would think about that.And in the second half of your question was with regard to the --Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystJust basically, how that played out for 2020. And I guess if I were to kind of ask a clarifying question, are you seeing any cancellations in your orders at all or is it just, really just deferrals at this point.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMostly deferrals as it is always the odd ball cancellation that you would do it always see in these businesses but I'd say nothing that's increased significantly. Mostly, it's really delays.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay. And then --Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerThat's particularly true on the larger industrial projects.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay, got it. Thanks, Rick. I guess my one follow-up. And somebody asked this earlier, but I wanted to see if we can get some type of quantification. On the aero margins, what's the expectation for R&D stepping down both this year and then into 2020?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think with respect to R&D, we've already seen the step down in R&D that's currently reflected in our businesses. And so today, I'd say we're probably running with respect to R&D as a percentage of revenue, we are probably running right now at historically low levels, primarily a function once again of new platform development from our customers, both on the commercial and the military side and so I would not expect an additional step down in R&D spending. It's really already reflected in the businesses run rate today in our earnings today.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay, got it. Thank you, guys.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research -- AnalystThank you. Good morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Jeff.Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research -- AnalystJust a question on restructuring and I'll wrap it around lighting, a little bit, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're doing on the restructuring front? Maybe help us think about how much additional there is in Q4 and is there kind of a stranded cost element with lighting that we should be thinking about?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say that if you think about the incremental restructuring in Q4. I mean, order magnitude, Jeff, we're talking about a couple of $0.02 to $0.03 or so in Q4 from where we've been and I think the source of that question is what do you do with the stranded cost, You sell a $1.7 billion business obviously there is some stranded costs associated with that and we would fully expect to deal with all of the stranded cost. And so we will obviously in the context of the overall restructuring number that we put up and the cost of the ex that we talked about a $200 million of costs associated with the exit of Lighting embedded in that number was cost to deal with stranded costs, both at the corporate level and also inside of Electrical Products. And so we would expect to fully deal with our stranded costs inside of the business.Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research -- AnalystCould you also elaborate a little bit, and I don't know if you need to pull it apart EP versus ESS but just kind of the trajectory of price in your business. And then just kind of the price cost algorithm looking into Q4 in the early part of next year.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, what we've always said around price cost is that we're net neutral and that's really today I'd say where we ultimately will end up. I think we're slightly positive in Q3, just slightly positive but we would expect once again on a go forward basis that commodity cost inflation tariff driven cost increases that the company will fully offset that and we'll do a better job of making sure that we're getting price at the same moment that we're experiencing the cost but we really expect it to be net neutral to Eaton overall.Jeff Sprague -- Vertical Research -- AnalystAll right. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.Andrew Obin -- Bank of America -- AnalystHi guys, how are you?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood.Andrew Obin -- Bank of America -- AnalystJust great execution. Question on Hydraulics, as we think about production cuts at Cat and Deere, when do those get incorporated into your revenues, are we seeing some of them in Q3 or is that something we're going to see in queue? When do we see the bulk of it, that's what I'm --Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question, Andrew as well because it's, what we've been dealing. We typically would run about 90 days in front of our customers in terms of whatever they're forecasting in Q4, we would have experienced in Q3 just given the lead time all the way back to the supply chain on many of the components that were sourcing and this is typical, by the way, if you take a look at this business over time, we typically see an outsize impact both on the way up and on the way down, when our big OEM customers go through these periods of a market correction.Andrew Obin -- Bank of America -- AnalystGot you. And then the question in terms of shortfall, I know there was a quote from you that you were expecting 3% you got 1% and I know you gave it to us by end markets but can you just give a big geography buckets which one disappointed the most and that is obvious. I mean --Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure. And I'd say that, in terms of end market specifically, it really was a down shifting in the growth rate let's say, the biggest market for us is always the US market and I would say --Andrew Obin -- Bank of America -- AnalystYeah, that's what I was referring to. Yes.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerStill positive growth for sure across the board but certainly we saw a downshifting in the rate of growth in the Americas, we saw it in our Electrical Systems and Services business in large projects we saw in the distribution channel and Electrical Products. We saw a downshifting and growth in the oil and gas space, specifically in our [Indecipherable] science business.Andrew Obin -- Bank of America -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Chris Glynn with Oppenheimer.Chris Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. So on Hydraulics with the restructuring kind of back-tail and a little more in the fourth quarter, and some comments about moving past inefficiencies. Just wondering can you raise margins a little on, you are moderately down revs next year and the 13% kind of the bottom of your through the cycle range. Do you see that is being attainable?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question and the goal that we set for this business 13% at the bottom of the cycle, we think it's absolutely the right goal for the business and we think it's certainly attainable. I think the real question becomes where do these markets ultimately bottom out at but I think it would not be an unreasonable expectation that the business deliver, 13% margin at the level of economic activity that we're seeing right now in the business.Chris Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystOkay, thanks. And then a bookkeeping one, any early kind of notional comments on the corporate guidance for next year? Should we just leave it comparable?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerWe have got to work through our planning. As a general matter, we have been quite successful at holding our corporate costs flat year-to-year. And then down years taking it down a little bit. So that will give you some color.Chris Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystPerfect, thank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan -- AnalystThank you. Most of my questions have been answered. If I look at ESS, the Momentum Index has been weak all year, up a little bit in September but that reflects new projects being considered and should be a good leading indicator for ESS for next year. Where is the disconnect because they're seeing is it may be not momentum index, but you're seeing the actual Dodge Data improves and that's subscribing current orders?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question and because we spent a lot of time obviously internally trying to figure this one out as well. It is a long-cycle business playing across a very wide set of end markets. And I'd say that a lot of the macro data to your point and what we saw certainly in our own order book in Q3 was quite positive and with orders up 5% on a rolling 12% and 8% excluding data centers, those are pretty strong numbers. And I'd say you can always find in this business that in any given quarter, you could end up with numbers that vary from the kind of the longer-term or medium-term growth rates.And I think what we experienced in Q3 as we indicated was this largely a pull back, a large projects and some project delays and a bit of slowdown on oil and gas, but certainly what we've seen in Q3 and what we see in most of the macro indicators for this business, non-res construction continues to do well across the world. I mean, a little bit of moderation in the growth rates but still growth. And so, we remain optimistic about the prospects for this business.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. I appreciate the color and then just a follow-up on e-mobility. You normally report mature year revenue win but that business has accomplished. Could you update us on that?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIn this quarter and I say we haven't had any new material wins in the quarter. So what we try to do in this business as you know these wins come in large chunks and as we get large material wins we will be sure to update you on how we're doing. But by and large we continue to be very optimistic. The business as we reported historically we are ahead of the schedule that we originally set out for the business and we're still extremely confident in our ability to create a $2 billion to $4 billion new segment for the Company.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay. And I have from the last quarter that you're material revenue wins were about 390 million, is that still what I should think about?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes I mean they would have moved up slightly from that end but we'll try to get report, material wins, when the number moves in a material way, we'll give you an update.Ann Duignan -- JP Morgan -- AnalystOkay, I appreciate that. That's it from me. Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystHi, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Julian.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystMay be just a first question around these ESS incrementals, very, very good performance. Just wanted to make sure that there was nothing particular you saw around mix or something as a tailwind that you think would fade, what do you think this is just normal course of business and reflect sort of good project discipline.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'd say that we obviously took a strong look ourselves that this business because the margins at 18.3% are very, very high and above our own expectations. And no, we did not see favorable mix in the quarter when we look at that issue specifically and it wasn't mix it really was largely this strong execution in the quarter. And I mean obviously there is always a mix of projects in any given quarter in ES&S.but no there was no particular unusual of one-time events that drove the performance.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. That's helpful. And then secondly maybe switching to Electrical Products. You do have some reasonably large industrial and industrial controls exposure within EP, particularly now that Lighting is coming out. Maybe talk about that more industrial piece of EP, how you saw demand trends there in recent months And if you expect in Q4 demand in that industrial piece of EP to be any different in Q4 than Q3.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe appreciate the question, without a doubt, that the weakest piece of the business today, year-to-date and what we're forecasting is really what's going on in industrial markets in the manufacturing sector. And we generally talk about that being about a third of the business itself. And so it's a big material segment for us and we clearly have continued to see weakness in the industrial controls part of the business.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerAnd then that was true Julian both on sales and orders in the third quarter.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystGreat, thank you very much.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsOur next question comes from Rob McCarthy with Stephens.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens -- AnalystHi, Rob McCarthy here. I guess the first question I would have is, and thinking about the sale Lighting, I mean I think it was 7.5 times trailing of certain we have less than have our afford basis or [Indecipherable] between 11 and 12 times for Cooper, even if that was like, I had a company average. I mean, yes, we will be good to have of maturity of what you're talking about. But this is an exactly value creating into you're buying assets 12 times and [Indecipherable] 7.5 times trailing call it seven or eight years later. So, I mean do you think that this kind of activity kind of the, why the fact that perhaps we should look they can look at a part of what we had breaking up the company.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerWell, Rob, let me just address that. I don't think your perspective is exactly correct, I mean do you have an idea the Lighting business when we bought Cooper. It was just under $1.2 billion and now at $1.7 billion, so we've grown the business quite significantly over the time period. And if you sort of disaggregate what we paid for the Lighting business as part of Cooper, it's not an awful lot different than what we sold it for. And now we thought that the business could migrate in certain ways and mailed closer to the broader Electrical franchise and it really has not and that's one of the reason we believe it's more appropriat as part of another Lighting enterprise or possibly as a public company, which was our original game plan but we would argue that we haven't dramatically impacted value in the case of Lighting. If it happen sometimes businesses don't end up developing in a way that you expect.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens -- AnalystAll right. And then in terms of the cash generation of the businesses. I mean, in the context of how you're thinking about your trough and the cash EPS trough, certainly, I think you would highlight rightfully so strong cash conversion overall. Are you still subscribing to the kind of the trough and the way to think about the trough as you articulated earlier in the year and as anything change there with respect to either cash generation in the down cycle or the trough itself, can we rely on that as we kind of anchor to win work particularly as we go into a tougher macro economic environment?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning OfficerIf you're talking about by trough, well our cash flow change markedly in a down year, we still believe it's not likely too, right. And simply because we liquidate working capital that offsets the profits loss through lower volume. So, even if we had down year at some point in the next couple of years, we don't think you'd see a market change in cash generation and one other point I would like to make about cash flow, I think it's important if you think about our free cash flow in 2019 based on the guidance we've given and that compared to 2018, we're guiding to up 23% and I think that's a pretty notable number. At the end of the day, the real value of most businesses of the cash they generate and we're generating really attractive increases in cash flow in '19 and we would expect continuity and debt cash generation next year.And absolutely cash flow is a very strong. I guess what I was alluding to specifically was the framework I believe Craig laid out for a trough scenario, we are still arriving to that.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes. You're talking about, we have at least flat EPS in a trough year and we continue to believe that is the base case plan. And the only caveat we'd add is that we said post the spin off of our sale of Lighting and post this divestiture of FCD and we would expect to get the FCD transaction done by the end of the year, and lighting some timing in Q1 but post those transactions we absolutely have the plan and fully committed to delivering flat EPS what we call a typical economic recession which we define is two to three quarters of GDP contraction.Rob McCarthy -- Stephens -- AnalystThanks for your time. I appreciate it.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsGood. Our last question come from Deane Dray with RBC.Deane Dray -- RBC -- AnalystThank you. Good morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi, Deane.Deane Dray -- RBC -- AnalystI was hoping to get a spotlight on a specific geography and a vertical, what can you tell us about China, the tone of business, the outlook and then data centers has come up during the call, any specifics there in terms of the outlook. Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI appreciate the question, Deane. I think China, if you think about across the broad swath of businesses that we deal and maybe deal with a positive first I'd say kind of the non-res construction and quite frankly even res construction in China, actually continues to perform very well and you see some of this data as well. But that will off starts in Q3, we're actually up 10% and are up 16% year-to-date. Residential starts are up 6% in Q3 and 9% year to date. And so the whole kind of construction market in China is doing well. And quite frankly, even on the Hydraulics side excavator sales continue to grow quite nicely in Q3, up 16% and excavators and up 7% in real world and so that piece of the business in China is actually doing quite well.By contrast, light motor vehicle production is down quite significantly, down 7% in Q3 and 12% year-to-date, as well as heavy-duty truck production is about flat. And so, it really is a very different story depending upon which end market you referring to. But in the most important part of our company, let's call it, in the Electrical side non-res construction the market is holding up quite well.Deane Dray -- RBC -- AnalystGreat.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd then typically the data centers, as we mentioned in the opening commentary, in our data center business performed very well in the quarter. We ended up seeing high single-digit growth in data centers and so that market continues to perform very well. And as we've mentioned on other earnings calls that the hyperscale stuff does tend to be lumpy, and we continue to see that lumpiness, but by and large, we continue to see very good growth in data centers.Deane Dray -- RBC -- AnalystCraig, just last one for me, the lowering of the capex by $50 million. Is there any story behind that?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, I'd say that's just really fine-tuning the outlook for the year. Our businesses tend to be low optimistic. The only course of the planning process around what they can get done, that's really just largely a true up. We've not done anything to put any clamps on our capex spending. We're still spending on every program that we can get done.Deane Dray -- RBC -- AnalystGreat, thanks for the color.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you all. We have reached to the end of our call. And we do appreciate everybody's question. As always Craig and I will be available to address any follow-up questions. Thank you all.

        "Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) Is Yielding 3.5% – But Is It A Buy? – Simply Wall St News": " Dividend paying stocks like Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason – some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it’s important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.  With Eaton yielding 3.5% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. It would not be a surprise to discover that many investors buy it for the dividends. The company also bought back stock equivalent to around 3.3% of market capitalisation this year. When buying stocks for their dividends, you should always run through the checks below, to see if the dividend looks sustainable.  Click the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis  Companies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company’s net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 53% of Eaton’s profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a healthy payout ratio, and while it does limit the amount of earnings that can be reinvested in the business, there is also some room to lift the payout ratio over time.  Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Eaton’s cash payout ratio in the last year was 44%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It’s positive to see that Eaton’s dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.  Before buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. Eaton has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$1.00 in 2009, compared to US$2.84 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11% a year over that time.  With rapid dividend growth and no notable cuts to the dividend over a lengthy period of time, we think this company has a lot going for it.  Dividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Earnings have grown at around 5.6% a year for the past five years, which is better than seeing them shrink! Earnings per share are growing at an acceptable rate, although the company is paying out more than half of its profits, which we think could constrain its ability to reinvest in its business.  Dividend investors should always want to know if a) a company’s dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. First, we think Eaton has an acceptable payout ratio and its dividend is well covered by cashflow. Second, earnings growth has been mediocre, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. Overall we think Eaton is an interesting dividend stock, although it could be better.  Companies that are growing earnings tend to be the best dividend stocks over the long term.

        "Eaton Reaches Agreement to Sell Its Hydraulics Business for $3.3 Billion ": "DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Power management company Eaton (NYSE:ETN) today announced it has entered into an agreement to sell its Hydraulics business to Danfoss A/S, a Danish industrial company, for $3.3 billion in cash. This represents a 13.2 multiple of 2019 EBITDA.\n\nEaton’s Hydraulics business, which accounted for 86 percent of Eaton’s Hydraulics segment revenue in 2019, is a global leader in hydraulics components, systems, and services for industrial and mobile equipment. The business had sales of $2.2 billion in 2019 and employs approximately 11,000 people.\n\nEaton is retaining the Filtration and Golf Grip businesses currently reported in the company’s Hydraulics segment.\n\n“Today’s announcement is part of the ongoing transformation of Eaton into a higher growth company with better earnings consistency,” said Craig Arnold, Eaton chairman and chief executive officer. “We believe this transaction will create substantial value for our shareholders and allow our hydraulics employees to be part of a company that has a strong commitment to the hydraulics industry.”\n\n“Eaton Hydraulics is a highly respected player in the global hydraulics industry, recognized for its dedicated people and strong brands,” said Kim Fausing, Danfoss president and chief executive officer. “By combining the knowledge and experience of these two companies, our customers will benefit from unmatched expertise from a single partner.”\n\nThe transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of the year.\n\nMore information on the transaction will be provided during Eaton’s quarterly conference call on February 4, 2020, at 11 a.m. Eastern time. Interested parties can access the live audio webcast via a link on Eaton’s home page, which is www.Eaton.com.

Factors that could cause these statements to become untrue include possible delay or failure of the satisfaction of all closing conditions. We do not assume any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.\n\nThis release also contains a non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is a commonly used measure of operating performance. We believe this measure will help investors understand the value of this transaction to Eaton.

        "Do You Know What Eaton Corporation plc's (NYSE:ETN) P/E Ratio Means?": "Yahoo Finance is the exclusive host of the live streamThe goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). We'll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to Eaton Corporation plc's (NYSE:ETN), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. Based on the last twelve months, Eaton's P/E ratio is 16.84. In other words, at today's prices, investors are paying $16.84 for every $1 in prior year profit. Check out our latest analysis for Eaton The formula for P/E is:Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)Or for Eaton:P/E of 16.84 = $95.16 ÷ $5.65 (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2019.)The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. All else being equal, it's better to pay a low price -- but as Warren Buffett said, 'It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price'.The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (19.0) for companies in the electrical industry is higher than Eaton's P/E.Its relatively low P/E ratio indicates that Eaton shareholders think it will struggle to do as well as other companies in its industry classification. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. You should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. That's because companies that grow earnings per share quickly will rapidly increase the 'E' in the equation. And in that case, the P/E ratio itself will drop rather quickly. A lower P/E should indicate the stock is cheap relative to others -- and that may attract buyers.It's great to see that Eaton grew EPS by 15% in the last year. And its annual EPS growth rate over 5 years is 9.7%. So one might expect an above average P/E ratio.The 'Price' in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).Eaton's net debt is 18% of its market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.Eaton's P/E is 16.8 which is below average (18.9) in the US market. The company hasn't stretched its balance sheet, and earnings growth was good last year. If the company can continue to grow earnings, then the current P/E may be unjustifiably low.Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about. If it is underestimating a company, investors can make money by buying and holding the shares until the market corrects itself. So this free visualization of the analyst consensus on future earnings could help you make the right decision about whether to buy, sell, or hold.But note: Eaton may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with strong recent earnings growth (and a P/E ratio below 20).If you spot an error that warrants correction, please contact the editor at editorial-team@simplywallst.com.

        "Principal Accounting Officer Ken Semelsberger Just Sold A Bunch Of Shares In Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) – Simply Wall St News": " We wouldn’t blame Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Ken Semelsberger, the Principal Accounting Officer recently netted about US$2.3m selling shares at an average price of US$105. That’s a big dump, and it decreased their holding size by 29%, which is notable but not too bad.  See our latest analysis for Eaton  The Vice Chairman and Chief Financial & Planning Officer, Richard Fearon, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.1m worth of shares at a price of US$90.05 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$105). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it’s only a weak signal. This single sale was just 15% of Richard Fearon’s stake.  Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 2.29k shares worth US$180k. On the other hand they divested 195203 shares, for US$17m. In total, Eaton insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!  I will like Eaton better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.  Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It’s great to see that Eaton insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about US$105m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.  Insiders haven’t bought Eaton stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn’t make us feel much more positive. On the plus side, Eaton makes money, and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we’re a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. Therefore, you should should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for Eaton.  But note: Eaton may not be the best stock to buy.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr Yan Jin. Please go ahead.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHey, good morning everyone. I'm Yan Jin, Eaton Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you all for joining us today for Eaton's fourth quarter 2019 earning call. With me today are Craig Arnold, our Chairman and CEO and Rick Fearon, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial and Planning Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Craig highlighting the company's performance in the fourth quarter. As we have done in our past calls, we'll be taking questions at the end of Craig's comments. The press release from our earnings announcement this morning and also the presentation we'll go through today have been posted on our website at www.eaton.com. Please note that both the press release and the presentation including reconciliation to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible on our website and will be available for replay.Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our comments today will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projected future earnings due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and presentation that are also outlined in our related 8-K filing. With that, I will turn it over to Craig.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOkay, thanks Yan, appreciate it. Hey, we'll start with Page 3 with our recent highlights. Two weeks ago, as everybody knows, we announced the agreement to sell our Hydraulics business to Danfoss for $3.3 billion, which represents a 13.2 times 2019 EBITDA. This decision is part of the ongoing transformation of Eaton into a company with higher growth, higher margins, and more consistent earnings. We're really pleased with that. We believe this transaction will create substantial value for our shareholders and allow our Hydraulics employees, importantly, become part of a company that has a strong commitment to the Hydraulics industry.Our team has made significant progress on other portfolio actions including closing the acquisition of Souriau-Sunbank and the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year. The sale of our Lighting business is expected to close in Q1 and as you've read, we've just announced the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc. Power Distribution, Inc. is a $125 million company that serves the data center market and will become part of our Electrical Systems and Services business.Switching to our Q4 results and I'd summarize the quarter's performance as one with strong earnings, record margins, strong cash flow despite slower than expected growth in our end markets. Organic revenue excluding Lighting and Hydraulics was down 2%. Earnings per share of $1.49 [Phonetic] on a GAAP basis and $1.46 excluding $0.28 of acquisition and divestiture costs and $0.09 for costs we expect to incur related to vehicle warranty. At $1.46, our results were flat with last year and at the high end of our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.46. Our sales of $5.2 billion were down 4% organically with negative currency of 0.5%, offset by 0.5% from acquisitions. We continued to generate strong margins and delivered a Q4 record of 17.8% excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected vehicle warranty costs. These margins were above the high end of our guidance range and 40 basis points above prior year. And we're also pleased with our operating cash flows, which were $937 million in the quarter. So stepping back, I think we'd all agree that it's been a busy and a very productive period for Eaton.Turning to Page 4, we summarize our Q4 financial performance and I'll note just a few highlights on this page. First, we increased our adjusted segment operating margins by 40 basis points and our team, I'd say here executed well and we had a detrimental margins of less than 10%. Second, our adjusted segment operating profits were $933 million, down 2% despite 4% lower organic sales. Net income of $452 million was down 28% and this was primarily due to acquisition and divestiture costs of $140 [Phonetic] million and vehicle warranty charges of $39 million, and both of these numbers I would note are on an after tax basis. Similar to Q3, these strong results are I think a good indication of how we intend to manage the company during periods of market weakness, running our operations efficiently, proactively managing costs and accelerating our share repurchases.Moving to Page 5, we'll start with our segment summaries with Electrical Products. Revenues were down 2% and excluding Lighting, organic revenue increased 1%. Strength was driven by residential markets in the Americas, our distribution business, and Canada. Adjusted segment operating profit increased 9% and adjusted operating margins were up 210 basis points to 20.3%, a Q4 record. The sale of our Lighting business to Signify for $1.4 billion remains on track and we expect to close in Q1. Excluding Lighting, orders were down 2% with strength in residential, commercial construction markets in the Americas, and this was really offset by industrial markets globally.Turning to Page 6, we show a summary of our Electrical Systems and Services segment. Revenues increased 4% with 2% organic and 2% from the acquisition of Ulusoy and Innovative Switchgear Solutions. Organic growth was driven by strength in the North American utility and commercial construction markets primarily. Adjusted segment operating profits increased 7% with adjusted margins of 17.1%, up 50 basis points over prior year and on a rolling 12-month basis, our Electrical Systems and Services orders increased 2.5% with growth really across all regions of the world. Excluding hyperscale data centers, the 12-month rolling average of orders was up some 4%. And just yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Power Distribution, Inc. which is a leading supplier of mission critical power distribution switching and power monitoring equipment for the data center market. Power Distribution, Inc. really builds on our strong position in the fast growing data center market and adds new capabilities in the area of overhead bus way and power distribution. So we're really pleased with the prospects of what PDI will add to our Electrical Systems and Services business.Moving to Page 7, we summarize our Hydraulics results for Q4. Revenues were down 13% with orders down 11% and this is driven by continued weakness in global mobile equip markets and destocking that continues at both OEM and then also with our distributors. And as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased to have announced the agreement to sell the Hydraulics business to Danfoss for $3.3 billion and we expect this transaction to close at the end of the year. And as we've announced, we are retaining our Filtration and Golf Grip businesses. We expect cash taxes from the sale of Hydraulics to be approximately $450 million, so our net proceeds will be approximately $2.85 billion. And a number of you have asked how we intend to use proceeds and I'd say that the options of additional acquisitions and share repurchases are both on the table. For M&A, I would also add that our pipeline remains very active and so it's great to have this optionality as we look forward.On Page 8, we summarize our results for our Aerospace segment. Revenues were up 3% including 2% organic and 1% from acquisitions. We experienced in this segment continued strength in commercial OEMs and also in commercial aftermarket. Orders on a rolling 12-month basis increased 6% with particular strength in military, aftermarket and biz jet. Certainly, strong execution in this segment led to a 9% increase in adjusted segment operating profits and 130 basis point improvement in adjusted margins which were 24.2%. And I'd just say here that the business delivered another quarterly record capping what's been a very strong year. We're also pleased to have closed the acquisition of Souriau in late December. We've welcomed the Souriau team to Eaton and our integration teams have already begun working to deliver the synergy plans, which includes the opportunity to take our new electrical connectors capabilities into our core electrical markets.Turning to Page 9, we summarize our Vehicle business for Q4. Revenues were down 19% and this includes 18% organic and 1% from currency. Declines here were due to a number of factors: the GM strike, Class 8 OEM orders, in fact, Class 8 production was down some 20% year-over-year and continued global weakness in light vehicle markets, which were down 9%. And I'd say here and a clear example of our grow the head and fix the tail strategy, which is really about how we've really focused the company, we completed the sale of our Automotive Fluid Conveyance business at the end of the year. During the quarter, we also took a $50 million pre-tax charge for expected warranty costs. This charge is being undertaken to correct the performance of one of our products that incorporated a defective part from a supplier and we're actively looking for ways of recouping these costs as well. Adjusted operating margins were 17%, at a very high level, but down 90 basis points from prior year.Next up on page 10, we summarize the results for our eMobility segment. Revenues were down 6% and I'd say here, while growth in electric vehicle platforms, this was more than offset by weakness in legacy internal combustion engine platforms. Operating margins declined to 1.3% due to a significant step up in research and development as well as manufacturing start-up costs associated with electric vehicle programs here. I would like to highlight that since the formation of this segment in the first quarter of 2018, the mature year revenue from new wins is expected to be $450 million and so this segment continues to run ahead of our own internal expectations and as you can imagine, we're pursuing a large number of additional programs as the industry continues to make the transition to electric vehicles.Before turning to 2020 guidance, I would like to take a minute just to summarize the results of 2019, which are shown on Page 11. First, we generated all-time record margins of 17.6%, which were up 80 basis points over 2018 excluding acquisition and divestiture costs and the expected warranty costs. In fact, over the last three years, our segment margins have increased 260 basis points, which we see as a strong validation of our strategy. Earnings per share of $5.76 excluding the one-time items I just mentioned was up 7% over 2018. We set all-time records for both operating cash flow of $3.5 billion and free cash flow of $2.9 billion, with growth of 17% and 20% respectively. Our free cash flow to sales was 13.4% and our free cash flow to net income conversion was 129%. This continues to be a key strength for Eaton and something that you can expect from us in the future. And as we noted, 2009 [Phonetic] was a year of significant progress on our journey to transform Eaton into a company with higher growth, higher margins and more earnings consistency. We closed three deals for $1.2 billion: Ulusoy, Innovative Switchgear in Electrical; Souriau-Sunbank in Aerospace. We announced two divestitures with Automotive Fluid conveyance closed in 2019 and Lighting scheduled to close in Q1. And our robust cash flow allowed us to return $2.2 billion to shareholders including $1.2 billion of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases. I'd also note that we purchased these shares at an average price of $80 a share. Finally, it was a very good year for our shareholders, who had a 43% total return, 50 [Phonetic] basis points over the median of our proxy peer. So overall, I'd say another record year and clearly very proud of what our team was able to deliver.Turning to Page 12, we provide our revenue and margin guidance for 2020. Overall, we expect organic growth to be anywhere from down 1% to up 1% with weakness in the first half and a bit stronger in the second half as a result of easier prior year comps. Beginning with Electrical Products, we expect to see 1% to 3% organic growth with continued strength in residential and data center markets, flat commercial construction markets, and continued weakness in industrial markets. In Electrical Systems and Services, we anticipate 0% to 2% organic growth with strength in utility markets, flat commercial construction, and weakness in industrial facilities and particularly in oil and gas markets. For Hydraulics, we're forecasting organic revenue declines of 4% to 6% driven by weakness in global mobile equipment markets and in Aerospace, we expect organic growth of 2% to 4% with continued strength in military OEM markets, solid aftermarket growth for both commercial and military markets partially offset by expected weakness in commercial OEM markets. For Vehicle, we see organic revenue declines of 7% to 9% and this is mostly due to the 33% decline that we're forecasting in NAFTA Class 8 truck markets, but also some weakness in global light vehicle markets as well. And for eMobility, organic growth is expected to be up 3% to 5%. We're seeing double-digit growth for our electrical vehicles markets, offset by some modest declines in internal combustion engine platforms.Now turning to segment operating margins and operating margins for Eaton. We expect Eaton to be 17.8% to 18.2% at the midpoint, a 40 basis points improvement from 2019 and in taking a look at our segments, Electrical Products we think will be 21.2% to 21.8%. At the midpoint, 180 basis point improvement from 2019 and this is primarily a result of the Lighting divestiture. For Electrical Systems and Services, we're forecasting 16.4% to 17%, up 10 basis points at the midpoint. Hydraulics at 11.7% to 12.3%, up 80 basis points at the midpoint. Aerospace at 22.9% to 23.5%, down some 110 basis points, and this is largely due to the acquisition of Souriau. And Vehicle we expect it to be between 15.7% and 16.3%, down 80 basis points and largely as a result of lower volumes, and eMobility at 2.5% to 3% [Phonetic] as we continue to invest heavily in R&D and start-up costs and new manufacturing capabilities.And on Page 13, we pick up the balance of our 2020 guidance and here I'd say we expect full year adjusted EPS to be between $5.60 and $5.90 at the midpoint of $5.75. This is essentially flat with 2019 when you exclude the one-time items noted on previous slides. Organic growth is expected to be essentially down 1% to up 1% with acquisitions adding 2% and divestitures negatively impacting sales by 7.5%. We expect our corporate costs including pension, interest and other corporate costs to be flat with 2019 levels and our tax rate to be between 14.8% and 15.8%. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion and capex of approximately $550 million. With strong cash flow plus the proceeds from the Lighting sale, which we think will be $1.4 billion, we plan to significantly increase our share repurchases and at this point, we expect to spend between $2.4 billion and $2.8 billion in share repurchases. And if I can just summarize our Q1 guidance, we expect EPS to be between $1.16 and $1.26; we expect organic revenues to be down 3%, 2% from acquisitions and 3% from divestitures; segment margins are expected to be between 15.8% and 16.2% and our tax rate should be between 15% and 16%.So overall, I'd say we expect really another solid year in 2020 with strong margins and cash flow. We have a lot of confidence in the Eaton business system and our ability to continue to execute strongly. We think the changes that we've made and announced will position Eaton for higher growth and higher margins and better earnings consistency as we go forward and with our strong cash flow and proceeds from the Hydraulics sale, we have outstanding optionality as we go into the best approach to create additional shareholder value. So with that, I'll stop there and turn it back over to Yan for questions.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHey, thanks Craig. Before we begin the Q&A section of our call today, I think that we have a number of individuals in the queue with questions. Given our time constraint of an hour, please limit your opportunity to just one question and a follow-up. Thanks everyone [Phonetic] for your cooperation. With that, I will turn it over to the operator to give you guys the instruction.Operator[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey, Jeff.Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystHey, two things from me, first on Hydraulics, given just kind of the slippery slope that the end markets are on, certainly great to see it go at that valuation, but are you guys subject to any kind of hold back or performance that could affect kind of the ultimate price that we receive for the asset?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, no, Jeff, we're not. I mean, and I think we actually posted our documents and so that information is certainly available for public consumption and the $3.3 billion number is firm and we fully expect to close as Danfoss has also agreed to take whatever remedies would be required in order to ensure that the transaction closes.Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystGreat and just a guidance question too, I was just wondering on ESS specifically 0% to 2%, does that sort of imply you're going to be up a bit in the first half and then down in the second half or how do you see that really playing out relative to what's going on in your backlog?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think we -- almost, Jeff, just the opposite of that and I mean given what we've seen certainly in our order intake and negotiations, we think that the back half of the year will be slightly stronger than the first half of the year and as we take a look at what we're experiencing today, one of the reasons why we guided to our overall revenues being down 3% in Q1 and so we do think that the back half of the year will be slightly stronger and a lot of that I'd say quite frankly is a function of easier comps when you look at the year-over-year comparisons and from an EPS standpoint, we're really pretty much well balanced in terms of what we've been historically where some 47% of our EPS is generated in the first half of the year and 53% in the second half and so that's very much consistent with our guidance this year as well.Jeffrey Sprague -- Vertical Research Partners -- AnalystGreat, thanks for the color.OperatorThank you very much. And our next question in queue that will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystGood morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystCraig, maybe just kind of starting off on Hydraulics and congratulations there, obviously. I guess as you think about the pipeline, you mentioned very active. I'd love to hear how you're thinking about potential prioritization of acquisitions and then also, you've been very active from a divestiture standpoint, are we done at this point?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the comment, Joe. As I mentioned in my opening commentary, we think it's an outstanding outcome for all parties. We think it's great for Eaton and our shareholders. We think it's outstanding for our employees and great for Danfoss as well. I'd say the priority for us really haven't changed. What we've said historically is that our priorities from an M&A perspective continue to be growing our Electrical business, Aerospace and also selectively we're looking at things we could potentially do in this new space for us called eMobility and so those priorities really have not changed. As I mentioned in my commentary, we are seeing today kind of a more active pipeline than we've seen historically and so as we think about the optionality of what we do with that cash, certainly M&A is an option, buying back shares is an option. So we're very much comfortable with where we sit in terms of making sure that we maximize shareholder value as we think about how we deploy those proceeds that will come in.And with respect to portfolio, we like where we sit. I mean at this point, think about the remaining parts of our company and I know there's been a lot of speculation about vehicles. So I'll go ahead and address that right upfront. We like our Vehicle business, it delivers extraordinary margins and they tend to be at the very top of their industry with respect to returns. The business today, given what we've done today with our joint venture in Cummins, will be a lot less cyclical as we go forward. It certainly helps us as the whole world moves toward this more electric outcome to getting the volume and scale that we need to really drive dividends across the organization and so, yes, we absolutely we like our portfolio and where we sit today.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThat's helpful and then just one quick one on aero, I don't recall you guys having much exposure to the MAX, but can you maybe just talk about that specifically as it relates to your guidance and also, how you think about margins in the aero segment as well in 2020 just given the strength in 2019?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think the MAX is an important program for Eaton as well. I think anybody in the aerospace industry, I'd say the MAX is going to be an important program for them and so our content tied to the MAX at the OEM level is order of magnitude just north of $100 million and what we've done as a part of the Aerospace forecast and our guidance is we've essentially taken what Boeing has given us in terms of their current build schedule and that's what's reflected in our Aerospace guidance, one of the reasons why we're not seeing more robust growth in our Aerospace business in 2020 is clearly the impact of the MAX. I will tell you as you think about the margin implications for the MAX, what you typically trade off with OEM volume is aftermarket volume. So we think from a margin perspective, independent of what happens with the MAX, we think the margins will be just fine. We think we'll be just fine from an EPS standpoint, but it could have certainly an impact on revenue. So our Aerospace margins, as we provided guidance, 2019 was a record year with really extraordinary improvement in our margins. The margins will be down slightly in 2020 and this, as we mentioned, was largely a function of the acquisition of Souriau, but also we were running at very frothy levels in 2019 in terms of the margins of the businesses. So we think the guidance that we provided for 2020 are very much in line with where we think the business should be.Joe Ritchie -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question will come from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystHi, good morning.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystAnd congrats on Hydraulics. I like everyone's comments. Can you help us or can you tell us what the exiting share count was and then how we should be thinking about the cadence of the repurchases through 2020?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'll address that. The total share count for Q4 was 415 million. It was not very different right at the end of the year. In terms of repurchases, we are going to do as we've done in the past. We decided against doing an accelerated repurchase and we're going to execute the transactions on our own. We do have the ability to buy about $70 million worth a day based on the Safe Harbor, so we can make significant moves fairly quickly and we will be executing those repurchases as we deem it most effective for our shareholders obviously taking into account market conditions.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat, thank you. And then as we think about the EP orders ex lighting down 2%, can you maybe help parse that out between end market and if you're still seeing any kind of destocking at your distributor partners?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the question. I mean, if we think about our markets, I mean as we provided a little bit of color on it, we think today that we still see growth in non-res construction, we did mention the fact that commercial construction we think is flat, we think industrial controls will be down, the residential continues to be up nicely, we think mid-single digit and in the IT piece, the data centers, which is reported for Electrical Products, we think will also be up low-single digit. And so, we think on balance, these markets continue to kind of bounce around the low kind of single-digit growth kind of neighborhood and we're hopeful once again as some of this uncertainty continues to ebb away as it relates to trade, as it relates to the North America trade agreement that, that continues to be buoy confidence in our customers in general, and I think in general, distribution is fine. I mean distribution certainly in Q4 held in there and our distributors are generally pretty positive around 2020. So we think distribution continues to be a strong point as well.John Walsh -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystGreat. I'll pass it along. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question in queue will come from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThanks, good morning guys. Obviously there's a lot of moving pieces on the portfolio. Just to be clear, so given the buyback you got in place for 2020, does that offset the dilution completely from Lighting, but you still have some dilution obviously come in the first half of the year. And then Rick on the tax rate, does the portfolio moves have any significant impact on the tax rate, both ex lighting, but also ex Hydraulics.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsI can answer both those questions. Yes, the buyback does offset the dilution. So that's why we're able to keep EPS flat between the years. And then the tax rate, we don't think will be changed from these portfolio actions. So we still think it will be between 14% and 16%.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, great. And my follow-up question is regarding distributor consolidation. Obviously, WESCO is an important channel partner for Eaton. How does fewer but larger distributor partners impact your business the way you go to market.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think it's obviously a question of which distributor combinations we're talking about it and as it relates to WESCO's acquisition of Anixter, which has maybe the one that's prompted the question, we think that's an outstanding combination for Eaton and our relationship with WESCO as we go forward and so we think that one is really positive for Eaton. We have a very strong relationship with WESCO as you know and we have a very strong relationship with Anixter and so we think that combination bodes extremely well for our future together and certainly is positive for Eaton.Nigel Coe -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGreat, thanks guys.OperatorThank you very much. The next question in queue will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystHi, good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHi Scott.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystLot of good questions have been asked already, but I would love to hear your view, Craig as you walk around the world, what markets you think are going to be or what geographies I guess more specifically, are going to be better or worse than perhaps 2019 run rate?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the question and I think in many ways, Scott, that is the $64,000 [Phonetic] question in terms of what the future economic outlook looks like and I'd say, if you'd asked me that question maybe three weeks ago before the coronavirus, I would say China for sure. I mean clearly we saw a much stronger Q4 in China. That economy had continued to strengthen. We'll see what the coronavirus does in terms of the impact in China, really the impact of it has around the world. We clearly see somewhat slowing growth in the U.S., but there are certainly pockets of strength. Residential markets continue to be quite strong, data center markets continue to be strong, utility markets continue to be strong. We think South America will have a better year than they had in 2019 as they work through some of their historical issues and so we're clearly seeing some strengthening in South America. We think Europe slows a bit overall. We think India had a really tough year in 2019. We think India is better as well and if you think about a lot of the emerging markets around the world, we think they generally have better years in 2020 than they did in 2019.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystOkay, helpful. And the one thing that I know eMobility is small, but what are you thinking over the next kind of three years we should be tracking and caring more about, is it the backlog that you're building in the business, but as you start to get a sell-through in 2021 that's meaningful that, that segment starts to move the needle with some sort of margin attached to it and just a sense of, is this a five-year out, three-year out or start to see progress kind of 1 year and change from now.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I appreciate the question, Scott and it's one that we get from others as well and we'd say that -- and the real inflection point for eMobility will be around 2022. A lot of these new electric vehicle platforms will launch in 2021 and so we think it's really 2022 before you get to the point where you start to see our revenues that have a meaningful impact on our eMobility segment and for Eaton overall, but as you think about the underlying assumption and what's going on in electrification in general, we think the story around electrification is obviously much bigger than what's going on at eMobility and passengers cars as we think about the more electric everything, you know, homes are becoming more electrified, commercial facilities. planes, trains, everything is becoming more electric and one of the real advantages we think we have with respect to our eMobility segment is that anytime you're dealing with automotive kinds of scales, you're now also creating real advantages that you can then take back into your core business as well and so we think there is a a much bigger story and a much bigger play for Eaton as we think about how we play in eMobility than just what happens in the light vehicle market.Scott Davis -- Melius Research -- AnalystOkay, perfect. Thank you. Good luck, guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorAnd our next question that will come from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystYeah, thanks, good morning guys.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Nicole.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystSo I just want to start with a clarification just I'm pretty -- 99% sure this is the way you guys are doing your guidance, but lighting is excluded beginning in the like first day of the second quarter, is that correct?Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsWe actually have put it in for two months sort of the middle of the first quarter.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, that's helpful. Thanks, Rick. And then when we think about rolling forward the calendar on free cash flow after you guys complete the Hydraulics sale, would that create a major change in your free cash flow relative to how you guys have guided for 2020?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, first of all, we expect the sale to conclude at the end of the year. So, it shouldn't have really any impact on 2020.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystAll right, but I'm thinking about like framing 2021 free cash flow.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, what I'd say Nicole, with respect to Hydraulics, I mean I think what you'll see from the company in general post Hydraulics is a company that will deliver once again more consistent free cash flow as a function of that industry in general. The cash flows in Hydraulics are about as volatile as the industry itself. And so I think what you'll see from Eaton post the divestiture of Hydraulics is a company that delivers once again very strong free cash flow and you'll see a lot more consistency overall.Nicole DeBlase -- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGot it. That's fair. Thanks, Craig. I'll pass it on.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThe next question in queue that will come from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.David Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, good morning. I have the math correct backing out Lighting and looking at the Electrical Products margins improvements [Phonetic], the guidance shows a 180 bps and it depends exactly the revenues for the 10 months that you won't have Lighting. I'm using about [Technical Issues] so I know we don't have the exact margin on Lighting but obviously it was below the segment average. So I'm just trying to back into what is the margin improvement just excluding Lighting from 10 months. I'm getting as much as a 140 bps, 130 bps and then that leaves the kind of legacy Electrical Products not really having to expand margins much to hit the target.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsYeah, I think that's a fair way of thinking about it, Dave, something just north of 100 bps of improvement from Lighting and some underlying improvement in the business is the right way to think about it.David Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAnd that said then if the margins are, let's say run rating close to 21 [Phonetic] just getting rid of Lighting. I know 2% organic is not that robust but still the margin improvement is a bit modest at least relative to your recent performance. Is there something within Electrical mix, price cost, whatever may be that's not allowing a little more expansion versus recent history.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, I'd say that we certainly had a very strong year in 2019 and posted very strong margin improvement. At this point, as we look at the year, we think this is the best way to think about the segment for the year. Could we be a little better than that? We hope so, but at this point, we think this is the right way to think about the segment and the appropriate guidance. And I might have missed this, I apologize, but the assets that are left in Hydraulics after the sale, are those potential opportunities for further potential opportunities for further sales during the course of this year or is it all just TBD for right now and -- If you think about what's remaining, and we did disclose a bit kind of in the context of the Hydraulics close, these are really attractive businesses that have great positions in their respective industries, we like those assets and we intend to retain them.David Raso -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay, thank you very much, I appreciate it.OperatorThank you. The next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystHi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around the data center market. I heard that the outlook is pretty good in the EP side, wondered if there was any nuance or difference within ESS and really the reason I ask is that the commentary perhaps as always from different people is mixed. Some of the Internet service providers sound fairly optimistic, some of the equipment suppliers like Regal or Cummins talked about push outs in data center activity this morning. So just wondered what your core assumption was for that market for this year in the medium-term?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, Julian, we appreciate the question and not surprising by the way that you do -- your commentary around the segment that in some cases could be in conflict depending upon where every supplier is and the timing of some of these large projects and where you are in terms of your exposure to hyperscale and other pieces of the market. I'd say for us, we do think that data center market based upon everything that we've seen, grows kind of low-single digit in 2020 which given kind of some of the underlying trends around data generation and consumption is a relatively modest number. We did in fact see a better second half of the year in hyperscale specifically and data centers continue to be growth segments for us overall, but I'd say that, no, I mean, Electrical Systems and Services, which as you know, more than three phase that we report as a part of ES&S and more the single phase that we report in Electrical Products, but we think that data centers largely as a category continues to be a very attractive category and then, but it will be lumpy. There will be periods of time when you see extraordinary growth and there'll be periods of time when some of the hyperscale guys essentially take time out to absorb kind of what they've actually done and will pause in their purchases.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you, Craig. And then a second question for you, maybe a slightly broader one. You've certainly surprised me with the success on the margin ramp the last couple of years, it's really been extraordinary. Just wondered if you were at all worried that that focus on the cost out hurt the organic growth profile of Eaton at all and how satisfied you are with that. If we look at the last five years or last 10 years, the organic sales cake is about 1% companywide. Do you think that the company is now poised for that to move higher in the medium-term.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMaybe I'll deal with the margin question first. Julian because I will tell you that if you think about where the margin expansion has come from inside of our company, it really has been essentially around eliminating operational inefficiencies in our company and so we've not in any way sacrificed growth opportunities for the sake of margin. I think it's really around a lot of the portfolio work that we're doing as we talk about, what is it that drives the margin expansion in Eaton and we talked about running our factories more efficiently, we talked about leveraging our scale and we talked about also where we focus. This idea of grow the head and shrink the tail and so those are the things that we've been doing as a company to accelerate margin expansion and quite frankly, we're not done, there's more opportunities there. On the organic growth front, I'd say we too have not been pleased with our organic growth. It's one of the reasons why we've really set that as the number one priority for the organization and we've been investing heavily in organic growth inside of our organization. And so we think that organic growth relative to the markets that we're in, we think we've been fine and in fact overall, public data that we get says that we've actually gained a little share in many of our businesses, but we need to do better than that and so that continues to be the number one priority for the organization to drive organic growth.Julian Mitchell -- Barclays -- AnalystThat's very helpful. Thank you.OperatorThank you. The next question in queue that will come from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystThanks a lot. Good morning, everybody.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Andy.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystWithin ESS ex the hyperscale data centers that just went through, in the past I think you talked about some project deferral in them. Incorporating the first half/second half directional comments I understand those, but are you seeing thaw in the uncertainty driven project deferral at this point.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say, Andy, maybe not really. We continue to see I'd say projects deferred. I'd say that the rate has not escalated from what we've seen in prior quarters, but there remains a fair amount of uncertainty around the global economy and so I think to the extent that we're dealing in this uncertain environment, whether it's trade or most recently the coronavirus, Brexit, I mean there has been a whole host of geopolitical events that have you have caused many of you know our customers in and around large projects specifically to wait and see a bit and that continues to be the case, but not necessarily at an increasing rate, more like in line with what we've seen during the course of much of -- the second half of 2019.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOkay. Thanks, Craig. And then secondly on potential acquisition opportunities. Can you talk about whether the pipeline is full at this point and relative to what you saw maybe last year, are the valuations becoming any more attractive?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I'd say the pipeline is certainly more active than we have seen a year ago and our teams are busy working through a number of potential opportunities. I think with respect to valuations, I'd say that not really. Valuations I think for the most part continue to be quite sporty and what we commit to you is that we will maintain our discipline. We have a very clear view on what our cost of capital is and what our expected returns are and so we will make sure that as we think about deploying our ample free cash flow that we're smart in the way we do it and we continue to be very comfortable with the option of buying back stock.Andy Casey -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOkay, thank you very much.OperatorThank you. The next question in queue will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHey, good morning guys. Craig, just a question for you on EP, one of your competitors this morning had some tariff exemption that helped out their electrical business and got a bit of a claw back going into even 2018. Anything that you guys qualified for in the EP portfolio and any benefit that was recognized?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo, not at all. There was no one-time benefits. We'd be interested to know what that was and we'll find out who that was and see if we missed something, but no, there's been -- there were no one-time benefits associated with tariff exemptions in our EP results at all.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsAnd Josh, we've commented that we produce in region for region. So we don't have large shipments coming out of China into other parts of the world. So it wouldn't be something where there would be a big opportunity for us.Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it. That's helpful and then just a follow-up on the acquisition pipeline, I think you guys have been very clear on your role in the data center or kind of being end to end on electrical and not really wanting to stray too far from that. I guess, Craig, are there any gaps in that, are there other pieces that you could add on to either on the front end or closer to the rack and as this market has evolved, are you seeing other product sets within the data center that just given the attractiveness of the end market start to look more interesting to you as you build out the portfolio. Thanks.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerHey Josh, I appreciate the question. I think on the margin, we have a great portfolio today that we offer and sell into data centers from all the power distribution equipment to the power quality equipment, we think this acquisition of PDI by the way as we mentioned, $125 million business, that goes into the data center market is very much about filling a product portfolio and also, in this case, giving us better access to the co-located -- the colo operators of data centers and so on the margins there is some minor things that we can do and we'll continue to look at, but by and large, we think our position in data centers is very well situated and no big gaps at all.Josh Pokrzywinski -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystAll right. Thanks, Craig.OperatorThank you very much. The next question in queue that will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystThanks, good morning and congrats on an excellent 2019.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsThanks.Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystOn the -- just wanted to kind of hit on Jeff's question about the ESS splits transferring that to vehicle on the down 8% organic, want to make sure we get the magnitude in the first half right. So I'm wondering how you seeing that linearity?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'm sorry -- so the transferring it to vehicle, I'm not sure [Speech Overlap]. Yeah, I'd say that if you think about kind of our guidance with respect to revenue, we do think that the second half of the year will be a bit stronger on a V basis versus the first half and I would say, but most of that I would just say is really more a function of the comps and the comparables year-over-year. If you take a look at the second half of 2019 was clearly a much weaker period of time for us than the first half. And so I think it's really a function of the comparables more than it is we're anticipating anything dramatically different in terms of the seasonality that we historically see in our business with respect to our own revenue growth.Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystOkay and then on the eMobility comments you made a couple of quarters in a row now of being ahead of plan. I'm wondering if you're seeing that in terms of the pace of design cycles or your win rates?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think there's probably a little bit of both on that one in terms of, I think that every major automotive OEM around the world and commercial vehicle customer around the world, everybody today has an initiative around electrification of their fleet and that has certainly gained momentum and we've been a benefactor of that and at the same time, our team has done an extraordinary job from a standing start really building a whole broad range of product capabilities that have enabled us to really be an effective alternative and a viable alternative in this particular space and so I think it's really been a combination.Christopher Glynn -- Oppenheimer -- AnalystThank you.OperatorThank you very much. And the next question in queue will come from Markus Mittermaier with UBS. Please go ahead.Markus Mittermaier -- UBS -- AnalystImprovements over the years, you've been closing the gap to a large extent across the Electrical business as some [Phonetic] of your global peers, particularly if you look at the European low voltage players. Now, how should we think about this going forward? I mean is there any structural reasons why these margins shouldn't align to where some of your peers are, I mean it's already mentioned that if I take out sort of the Lighting impacts in EP ex lighting, you're basically already up the margin levels that you're guiding for. So how should be structurally think about this, maybe not into 2020 but sort of medium-term, how much upside is there to closing that gap to the peers fully?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I guess, Markus, I mean, the first thing I would say with respect to our Electrical business, I'd say we don't believe there is a gap. In fact, we think today, when you take a look at our Electrical business relative to most of our peers that our margins are actually as good as or better than most of them. You have to really think about it in the context, I'm not sure which companies you're referring to, but our Electrical Products business for example, which is largely a components business that goes through distribution and those margins we think compare very favorably to the industry overall and in Electrical Systems and Services, I'd say once again that business performs very favorably and I think it's really -- you got to really think about the peers in the context of we play across the whole spectrum of electrical, some of the peers that maybe you're referencing tend to be more niche, maybe they are a Electrical Products business only or they are a components business only, but when you look at in aggregate against our primary peers, the ones who play across the whole spectrum in Electrical, I would argue that our margins are as good or better than almost any of our competitors and by the way I would acknowledge that we're not done. We think we have opportunity that remains to continue to expand margins and that's clearly what we expect to do and we'll -- as a part of our investor meeting in the first week of March, we'll provide some guidance around what we think the future outlook looks like.Markus Mittermaier -- UBS -- AnalystSure. Great, that's very helpful and then just briefly as a follow-up on aviation, aftermarket OE, what was that split sort of in Q4 and what's embedded in the guide for 2020 here?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think you can think about our business as 60:40. 60% OE, 40% aftermarket and those numbers vary slightly depending upon what quarter you are talking about or what year you're talking about, but kind of the long-term view, 60%, 40% split is generally where we're at.Markus Mittermaier -- UBS -- AnalystGreat, thank you very much.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. The next question that will come from Mig Dobre with Baird. Please go ahead.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystYes, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a good 2019. I wanted to go back to ESS as well and maybe ask a couple of things. On power distribution, can you give us some color on the margin for that business and then how do you think about the cadence of this segment's margin through the year given that you've got some pretty difficult comps on incrementals in Q2 and Q3?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, our power distribution margins inside of Electrical Systems and Services I'd say are largely in line with the segment overall. So I don't know that we see significant differences in the margins in power distribution assemblies overall though obviously projects can impact that perhaps a little bit more than some of the other parts of the business. In terms of cadence, I mean this business always tends to be a little bit back end loaded and if you think about the company split of revenue, first half/second half, Electrical Systems and Services always tends to be a little bit of a back-end loaded business and as a result, you get higher volume and higher margins in the second half of the year and I think that's just very much consistent with what we've seen from this business over a very long period of time.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystYeah, Craig, just to clarify, I was talking about the acquisition -- the power distribution acquisition.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOh PDI, OK. Yes, PDI's margins I would say today are below the average for Electrical Systems and Services. We obviously, we like the business, we like the space. We think we have an opportunity to clearly expand margins, but they do come in to the company at slightly below the margins of the segment overall.Richard H. Fearon -- Vice Chairman, Chief Financial and Planning Officer and Member of the Board of DirectorsAnd we'll make some improvement in terms of synergies this year, but probably more so in 2021 in PDI.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystSure and then lastly on Hydraulics, just looking at your guidance, your margin guidance for 2020 and kind of comparing it to what we've seen exiting 2019. How do you think about the drivers for margin expansion here and what's different going forward than what we've seen in 2019. Thank you.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think the answer in Hydraulics -- we've spent a lot of time over the last couple of years talking about the level of inefficiencies that we were driving in the Hydraulics business as we dealt with this pretty significant market ramp in the midst of a perhaps the biggest restructuring program in the history of the business and so, as I mentioned in prior calls, we were kind of caught in the middle of doing this massive restructuring and movement of parts and pieces when the industry ramped and we had a lot of inefficiencies that were in the business as we were halfway complete in terms of many of these restructuring programs and so as we think about 2020 and where the improvement comes from, it's largely a function of getting these things completed and behind us and we're very confident in our ability to deliver the margin guidance that we've laid out for Hydraulics.Mig Dobre -- Baird -- AnalystGreat, thank you.OperatorThank you very much. The next question that will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Deane.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystHey, just got a couple of quick ones here. First, when I look at the 2020 guidance, the organic revenue growth of minus 1% to plus 1% seems a bit tighter than I would have expected just given the macro uncertainty. So maybe some reflect on that if you could and is there any impact now with the recast portfolio, earnings -- better earnings consistency, does that reduce some of the cyclicality and might that explain some of the tighter range?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, I think the first thing. Dean, to your point, I mean we agree it's a fairly tight range and we could have said approximately flat, but there always is a fair amount of uncertainty in general in these businesses and so I'd say I wouldn't over read at least for 2020 the fact that the range is minus 1% to plus 1% other than to say that we think our markets are going to be approximately flat for the year is the right way to think about that and to your point, lots of uncertainty, we'll see how the year unfolds, but that's really where we've landed at as an organization. Yeah, I do think, to your point though, as we go forward, once we get beyond 2020 into 2021 and we get Hydraulics divested, there is no question that there'll be a lot more earnings and revenue consistency inside of the organization when you go forward. And so it's very much consistent with the strategy that we laid out around driving better consistency of earnings. Hydraulics will help tremendously in that regard. I wouldn't over read the minus 1% to plus 1%.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGood, I promise not to over read. And then just last question would be -- it is interesting how many questions you've had today on data center. Obviously, some of it from Network Power acquisition, but what do you make of the new ownership of the former Emerson Network Power and does that change in any way expectations about some of the competitive dynamics, maybe some more price competition. I'd be interested in your thoughts there?Craig Arnold -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI mean, I'd say -- appreciate the question, Deane and I know Dave Cote well, I used to work from him by the way, so it's -- I can imagine that he will certainly bring some strong leadership to that business, but no, we'd say we love our position in data centers. Today, if you think about where we play and first of all, we don't overlap completely with Vertiv. I mean we play in -- in some -- many cases, different parts of the market than they do, but we think we're clearly number one or number two in the world depending upon where you're at in data centers. We like our strategic position there. We think at the end of the day, competition is good, it will make us all better, but we like our position in data centers and we think we're well positioned. We think we continue to do extraordinarily well in that market and so, no, we don't think it changes the competitive dynamic at all.Deane Dray -- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.Yan Jin -- Senior Vice President of Investor RelationsHey, good. I thank you all. We have reached the end of the call and we do appreciate everybody's questions. As always Chip [Phonetic] and I will be available to follow-up. Thank you all for joining us today.
