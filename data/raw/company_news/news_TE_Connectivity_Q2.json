Impac will be an authorized reseller of AMT’s post-processing system, PostPro3D, adding to Impac’s extensive portfolio of 3D printing technologies which already includes Materialise Magics software and HP’s 540/580 and 4200/5200 MJF series.Elsewhere, in Amsterdam, leading 3D printing services provider Oceanz has announced a partnership with AM-FLOW to develop a series of fully automated AM production lines. The project aims to support the industrialization of AM by automating a number of post-processing steps that are currently done manually and are comparatively time-consuming.Stefan Rink, CEO of AM-FLOW, stated: “Now is the time that AM becomes a serious alternative for traditional mass production methods. To achieve this, we have to create a fully digital workflow and minimize manual processes. With our AM-FLOW technology, we are able to offer this end-to-end digital industrialization.”Further South, Australian metal AM specialist Titomic has announced a partnership contract with Ascent Aerospace to bring Titomic’s Kinetic Fusion (TKF) technology to Ascent’s extensive aerospace customer base. The partnership comprises two separate phases. The first is the validation phase, whereby Titomic will produce a customer approved Invar36 tool using its TKF9000 metal AM system. This will act as a production feasibility trial before wide-scale adoption takes place. The second phase is the adoption phase, whereby a joint sales strategy for the supply of aerospace tooling will be established between the two companies. As the global demand for aerospace tooling grows, this will help reduce the long lead-times currently found in the industry.Titomic has also appointed BTech Innovation as its sales and distribution partner in Turkey. As Titomic’s authorized distributor of systems and metal powders, BTech will offer TKF1000 systems, TKF9000 systems, TKF production line systems, consultation, OEM production, metal powder consumables, and design and prototyping services.TWI and Leitat, two international research and technology organisations, have announced a partnership to help European SMEs on their path to digitization, specifically implementing 3D printing into their process chains. The aim of the collaboration is to develop projects that will address industrial needs in AM, through research and development, testing and experimenting, and providing educational training in associated technologies. The duo hopes to see an increased AM technology adoption rate in the future.UK-based Protolabs has announced the decision to add Carbon Digital Light Synthesis (DLS) to its rapidly expanding portfolio of six different AM technologies. The prototyping company’s customer base will now benefit from DLS’s ability to produce intricate designs and durable end-use components that other manufacturing methods currently struggle with. Customers will be offered materials comparable to ABS and polycarbonate, which are known for their consistent industrial-grade mechanical properties.“We’re very excited about the manufacturing options the Carbon technology offers to our customers,” said Vicki Holt, President and CEO at Protolabs. “It provides a cost-effective production solution for geometric complexities that cannot be molded or otherwise fabricated. We are committed to maintaining our market leadership in being a single source supplier for on-demand services across a multitude of manufacturing methods, and Carbon will help us do that.”Finally, Solidpro, a HP Gold Partner, has announced that it will be investing in DyeMansion, the world leader in AM finishing systems. The addition of DyeMansion’s post-processing capabilities to Solidpro’s portfolio of services will enable Solidpro customers to have access to the complete AM value chain. Solidpro intends to be more than just a joint sales partner in this instance, as the company will also be offering additional consulting and benchmark production services.Steffen Hägele, Team Leader, 3D Printing at Solidpro, stated: “We are pleased to have found a strong partner in DyeMansion, who understands the market requirements in the field of post-processing and provides the appropriate solutions and continuously develops them further. The DyeMansion products harmonize perfectly with the HP Multi Jet Fusion technology and support our customers on their path to automated, professional additive manufacturing”.BigRep marks the delivery of its 500th large-format 3D printerBigRep, famous for its large-format industrial 3D printers, celebrates the delivery of its 500th industrial system since its inception in 2014.

(NYSE:TEL) to see whether it might be an attractive investment prospect. Specifically, we're going to calculate its Return On Capital Employed (ROCE), in the hopes of getting some insight into the business.First up, we'll look at what ROCE is and how we calculate it. Then we'll compare its ROCE to similar companies. Finally, we'll look at how its current liabilities affect its ROCE.ROCE measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. In general, businesses with a higher ROCE are usually better quality. Ultimately, it is a useful but imperfect metric. Author Edwin Whiting says to be careful when comparing the ROCE of different businesses, since 'No two businesses are exactly alike.Analysts use this formula to calculate return on capital employed:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)Or for TE Connectivity:0.13 = US$2.2b ÷ (US$20b - US$3.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2019.)So, TE Connectivity has an ROCE of 13%.  See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ROCE is commonly used for comparing the performance of similar businesses. Using our data, TE Connectivity's ROCE appears to be around the 11% average of the Electronic industry. Independently of how TE Connectivity compares to its industry, its ROCE in absolute terms appears decent, and the company may be worthy of closer investigation.The image below shows how TE Connectivity's ROCE compares to its industry, and you can click it to see more detail on its past growth.When considering this metric, keep in mind that it is backwards looking, and not necessarily predictive. ROCE can be deceptive for cyclical businesses, as returns can look incredible in boom times, and terribly low in downturns. This is because ROCE only looks at one year, instead of considering returns across a whole cycle. Future performance is what matters, and you can see analyst predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Liabilities, such as supplier bills and bank overdrafts, are referred to as current liabilities if they need to be paid within 12 months. Due to the way the ROCE equation works, having large bills due in the near term can make it look as though a company has less capital employed, and thus a higher ROCE than usual. To counteract this, we check if a company has high current liabilities, relative to its total assets.TE Connectivity has total assets of US$20b and current liabilities of US$3.4b. As a result, its current liabilities are equal to approximately 17% of its total assets. Current liabilities are minimal, limiting the impact on ROCE.This is good to see, and with a sound ROCE, TE Connectivity could be worth a closer look.

    "https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/tech/nyse-tel/te-connectivity/news/is-te-connectivity-ltd-nysetel-excessively-paying-its-ceo/": " Terrence Curtin became the CEO of TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) in 2017. This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies. Then we’ll look at a snap shot of the business growth. And finally – as a second measure of performance – we will look at the returns shareholders have received over the last few years. The aim of all this is to consider the appropriateness of CEO pay levels.  Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity  According to our data, TE Connectivity Ltd. has a market capitalization of US$23b, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$9.3m over the year to September 2019. That’s below the compensation, last year. While we always look at total compensation first, we note that the salary component is less, at US$1.2m. We further remind readers that the CEO may face performance requirements to receive the non-salary part of the total compensation. We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO total compensation to be US$12m. Once you start looking at very large companies, you need to take a broader range, because there simply aren’t that many of them.  Now let’s take a look at the pay mix on an industry and company level to gain a better understanding of where TE Connectivity stands. On a sector level, around 34% of total compensation represents salary and 66% is other remuneration. It’s interesting to note that TE Connectivity allocates a smaller portion of compensation to salary in comparison to the broader industry.  So Terrence Curtin is paid around the average of the companies we looked at. While this data point isn’t particularly informative alone, it gains more meaning when considered with business performance. You can see, below, how CEO compensation at TE Connectivity has changed over time.  Over the last three years TE Connectivity Ltd. has seen earnings per share (EPS) move in a positive direction by an average of 16% per year (using a line of best fit). It saw its revenue drop 5.2% over the last year.  This demonstrates that the company has been improving recently. A good result. The lack of revenue growth isn’t ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Shareholders might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.  Given the total loss of 2.9% over three years, many shareholders in TE Connectivity Ltd. are probably rather dissatisfied, to say the least. It therefore might be upsetting for shareholders if the CEO were paid generously.  Remuneration for Terrence Curtin is close enough to the median pay for a CEO of a large company .  We’d say the company can boast of its EPS growth, but we cannot say the same about the lacklustre shareholder returns (over the last three years). Considering the improvement in earnings per share, one could argue that the CEO pay is appropriate, albeit not too low. Shifting gears from CEO pay for a second, we’ve picked out 3 warning signs for TE Connectivity that investors should be aware of in a dynamic business environment.
