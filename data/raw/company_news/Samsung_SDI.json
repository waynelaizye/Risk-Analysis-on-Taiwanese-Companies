They are expected to bag even more new contracts this year, according to local analysts.¬†‚ÄúIt is one of the few industries rising at double-digit growth rates, so battery makers are upbeat this year,‚Äù Park Jae-bum, senior researcher at Posco Research Institute told The Investor. ‚ÄúIn that sense, the battery industry is very close to being like the semiconductor sector whose exports amount to 140 trillion won a year.‚Äù Park and other analysts attributed the growth to better-than-expected EV sales amid tightened environmental regulations in Europe and China. Their prediction is that the upward trend will continue for the next several years. This year, manufacturers are expected to sell 4 million units, which is double that of last year. The battery market will grow rapidly along with the EV market, which is expected to increase to 22 million by 2025, taking up 21 percent of the automobile market. Backed by the EV boom, LG Chem‚Äôs battery business turned around for the first time in the fourth quarter last year since it entered the sector in 2000, becoming the first Korean firm to post a profit in this business. Raising the entry bar Last year, China‚Äôs CATL and BYD together occupied 34.9 percent of the market, while Japan‚Äôs Panasonic took up 21.9 percent. Meanwhile, LG Chem had a 10.2 percent market share, while Samsung SDI took up 5.5 percent, according to battery market research firm SNE Research.These five companies are expected to continue dominating the EV battery market, with their combined market share remaining upward of 70 percent by 2025, according to Switzerland‚Äôs UBS Group analyst Colin Langan. In 2017, their combined stake stood at 56.1 percent, rising to 73.4 percent in 2018. ‚ÄúOverseas automakers are not using Chinese products and most Chinese companies except CATL are heavily relying on their domestic markets. It would take some time for Chinese firms to earn the trust of automakers who are working with LG Chem and Samsung,‚Äù Posri‚Äôs Park said. At the same time, the Chinese government is reducing subsidies for EVs and will scrap them as early as next year. This is stirring upChina‚Äôs battery industry, forcing smaller and uncompetitive firms to close down. This also means Korean and other overseas companies would have a chance to grab higher market share. The Korean battery makers recently announced massive investment plans that would help raise the entry barrier for many latecomers.SK Innovation has announced a series of aggressive investment plans worth 3 trillion won to build facilities in Hungary, China and the US. It plans to expand its annual production capacity to 60 GWh by 2022 with an ambitious plan to become the No. 3 battery maker by 2025.

        "Volkswagen's battery supply may be in trouble ": "There are concerns at Volkswagen that a supply contract with Samsung SDI worth around 50 billion euros could be called off. The Koreans are said to have originally agreed to supply battery cells with a total capacity of just over 20 GWh to VW.However, the deal now appears to have got down to a mere 5 GWh, reports Bloomberg, citing insiders. According to the news agency, Volkswagen and Samsung SDI have different ideas about the production volume and schedule, which is why Samsung‚Äôs delivery commitment could ultimately fall to a volume of less than 5 GWh.At the end of last year, Volkswagen set the course for its massive electric offensive with regard to cell deliveries. To this end, the carmaker secured deals with several strategic battery cell suppliers. In addition to LG Chem and Samsung SDI, CATL and SK Innovation were also contracted to supply battery cells. With SKI as the fourth manufacturer in the alliance, Volkswagen was confident in November that ‚Äúthe most important strategic suppliers of battery cells for equipping the Group‚Äôs rapidly growing electric fleet in the most important regions of the world‚Äù had been named.Volkswagen‚Äôs need for cells is immense in view of the target set in its Roadmap E with 50 new all-electric vehicles by 2025. At this point, the Wolfsburg company says it needs a battery capacity of more than 150 GWh per year. This corresponds to an annual capacity of at least four Gigafactorys on the Tesla scale, which is now regarded as a sort of industry standard.Neither Volkswagen nor Samsung have officially stated whether the contract really threatens to bust. The Wolfsburg-based company merely let it be known that Samsung would continue to supply battery cells to Europe. Samsung‚Äôs headquarters did not issue a statement.In the meantime, Volkswagen has decided to venture into the mass production of battery cells for electric cars. The partner will not be SK Innovation, as expected, but the Swedish start-up company Northvolt. The plan is to build a plant in Salzgitter with a total annual capacity of almost twelve-gigawatt hours. With increasing demand, the capacity could be increased to around 30 GWh per year, but production had to start stable two weeks ago.bloomberg.com‚Äì ADVERTISEMENT ‚Äì    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Your email address will not be published.

The South Korean component maker showcased various goods at ESS Europe 2019 in Munich, Germany, and unveiled offerings aimed for both home and industrial use. The flagship offering among them is the ESS product, E3, which the company said  has 20% more energy density compared to its predecessors.  The higher density will allow customers to conserve space, according to the Korean tech giant.¬†The E3 is aimed at new energy power plants, such as those dealing with solar and wind energy, where energy production can fluctuate widely. The ESS will allow these plants to store electricity when production is high and use them later, Samsung SDI said. Samsung SDI said the E3 will be offered in the same module size and rack design as previous offerings so there is no increased overhead for clients. The company also showcased a 100Ah ESS power cell and high-power ESS modules aimed at households. Home ESS use is especially high in Europe and 146,000 units are expected to be shipped there by 2020, according to market research firm B3. Samsung first launched the E2 back in 2017 and has expanded its offerings to not only¬†enterprise¬†clients, but consumers¬†as well. Global clean energy initiatives have resulted in the rise of ESS demand globally. According to SNE Research, the global ESS market is expected to grow 31% per year, from 11.8 gigawatt hours (GWh) last year to 77.6 GWh in 2025.

        "Samsung SDI&apos;s Q1 operating profit rises 65 pct on EV batteries ": "All HeadlinesNorth KoreaSportsTop NewsMost ViewedKorean Newspaper HeadlinesToday in Korean HistoryYonhap News SummaryEditorials from Korean DailiesURL is copied.By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, April 30 (Yonhap) -- Samsung SDI Co. said Wednesday its first-quarter operating profit jumped 65 percent from a year ago on the back of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles, but sluggish domestic demand for its energy storage system (ESS) moderated its revenue.  The battery-making unit of Samsung Electronics Co. said its operating income stood at 119 billion won (US$102 million) in the January-March period, compared with an operating income of 72 billion won a year earlier. Its sales rose 20.7 percent on-year to 2.3 trillion won, but its net profit tumbled 64 percent to 58 billion won over the period due to losses from its equity ties with Samsung Display Co. The battery maker holds about a 15 percent stake in Samsung's panel making unit.  Samsung SDI said strong sales of EV batteries in Europe, as well as small batteries used in electronic devices and electric motorcycles, boosted its quarterly profit.  The firm supplies battery packs for BMW's EVs and Harley-Davidson's electric motorcycles. A sharp drop in ESS demand in the domestic market, however, weighed on its overall profits amid an ongoing investigation into fires that broke out at ESS facilities of LG Chem Inc., a major battery maker, last year. The government's renewable energy initiative boosted domestic demand for ESS last year, but the series of fires at the facilities has raised safety concerns over the system, considered essential for clean energies, such as solar and wind power. Samsung SDI was upbeat about its second-quarter earnings on the back of rising demand for EV batteries and ESS in overseas markets, including the United States. \"Mid- to large-sized batteries are expected to post robust earnings in the automotive sector, and overseas sales of ESS are expected to increase in major markets,\" Samsung SDI said in a release. \"The small battery division is also expected to post improved profits in the second quarter on increasing demand for high-voltage products for electronic devices and cordless vacuums.\" ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)All HeadlinesNationalNorth KoreaEconomyMarketScienceCultureSportsImagesVideosTop NewsMost Viewed Korean Newspaper HeadlinesToday in Korean HistoryYonhap News SummaryEditorials from Korean DailiesKorea in BriefUseful LinksFestival CalendarWeatherAdvertise with Yonhap News Agency"

        "Volvo & Samsung to develop e": "The Volvo Group and Samsung SDI have formed a strategic alliance to develop battery packs specifically for Volvo electric trucks. Samsung SDI will supply the battery cells and modules to the Volvo Group that will assemble these in its facilities. Since Volvo and Samsung SDI have not disclosed any more details about the scope of the cooperation, the exact order volume and the battery capacity to be supplied remains unclear.Volvo started delivering its first electric trucks to selected customers in February this year. Series production of the two models Volvo FL Electric and Volvo FE Electric will start in the second half of 2019 with a limited number of vehicles for the European markets.In the future, the commercial vehicle manufacturer expects sales of its electric models to increase. For this reason, the Swedish company has now allied with the Korean battery manufacturer Samsung SDI. ‚ÄúThe alliance with Samsung SDI is an important next step on our journey towards offering the world‚Äôs most truly sustainable transport system with fossil-free alternatives for our commercial vehicles to the commercial vehicle industry and beyond,‚Äù says Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO of the Volvo Group.In April last year Volvo Trucks said it would market the battery technology across brands to reduce cost. They would not only share their tech with electric trucks though but also with buses and heavy industries.Samsung brings its battery expertise to the partnership, while Volvo gives the battery manufacturer insight into the specific requirements of the commercial vehicle business. ‚ÄúAs we stand at the crosscurrents of the mobility and transportation industry, we are convinced that this alliance will provide superior offerings pertaining to energy, safety and sustainability,‚Äù said Young-Hyun Jun, CEO of Samsung SDI. They are confident that the alliance will secure the market leadership of both companies in the long term.Volvo‚Äôs truck division is thus following a different path than the Volvo Car Group, which has been operating independently for years. In May Volvo Car Group signed long-term supply contracts with Samsung‚Äôs Korean competitor LG Chem and CATL from China. The Volvo Car Group belongs to the Chinese car manufacturer Geely, which also holds around 8 per cent of the capital and 16 per cent of the voting rights in the commercial vehicle manufacturer Volvo Group.Volvo‚Äôs construction machinery subsidiary Volvo Construction Equipment recently announced that it would launch a series of compact electric wheel loaders and excavators in mid-2020 and stop developing new diesel engines for these vehicles. The subsidiary is now investing 16 million Swedish crowns (around 1.5 million euros) in its Eskilstuna site. Among other things, the money will flow into an arena for customer demonstrations of electric and autonomous machines. In March, Ericsson installed Sweden‚Äôs first 5G mast for industrial applications so that Volvo CE could test its remote-controlled machines with short response times.volvogroup.com, (Samsung SDI), volvoce.com‚Äì ADVERTISEMENT ‚Äì    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Your email address will not be published.

        "BMW is buying billions worth of batteries from CATL and Samsung SDI ": "The BMW Group has awarded the two battery cell manufacturers CATL and Samsung SDI further orders worth several billion euros. The German carmaker intends to cover their battery cell requirements until 2031.The CATL order volume, which originally stood at four billion euros when it was announced in mid-2018, will increase to 7.3 billion euros (contract period: 2020 to 2031). The cells will be delivered from 2020 to 2031. In addition, the BMW Group has concluded a long-term supply contract with Samsung SDI. The contract has an order volume of 2.9 billion euros (contract period: 2021 to 2031).The cells from the two suppliers will thus be used in the fifth generation of eDrive drives, which BMW intends to install for the first time in the iX3 announced for 2020. Later, the i4 and the series version of the iNext will also feature this technology. The iX3 will first be launched in China and will then receive CATL cells from local production.The CATL cells for the models made in the German plants will then come from the CATL battery cell plant currently under construction in Erfurt ‚Äì BMW says it is the plant‚Äôs first customer. ‚ÄúWe have intensively supported and accompanied the establishment of CATL in Germany,‚Äù says Andreas Wendt, Board Member of BMW AG for Purchasing and Supplier Network.‚Äì ADVERTISEMENT ‚Äì    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});Together with the Samsung deal, BMW wants to cover its demand for battery cells for its electrified vehicles (BMW is currently relying more on PHEV than BEV). ‚ÄúEach cell generation is awarded to the technologically and economically leading manufacturer in global competition,‚Äù says Wendt. ‚ÄúThis gives us access to the best possible cell technology at all times‚Äù.With the switch to the fifth generation of electric drives, BMW is also facing a paradigm shift in its purchasing policy: from 2020, the Munich-based company will purchase the two key raw materials cobalt and lithium directly from the raw material mines ‚Äì in the case of cobalt in Morocco and Australia.

        "Samsung SDI, LG Chem Come up with ESS Safety Measures ": "Samsung SDI and LG Chem have unveiled safety measures to prevent their energy storage systems (ESS) from being ravaged by fires due to the explosion of components.The two companies announced on Oct. 14 plans to apply fire-prevention technologies to their products. Their¬†move is designed to address¬†safety concerns about their systems that have been plaguing the entire domestic ESS industry in recent years.Since August 2017, there have been 23 ESS-related fires. The government launched an investigation late last year and announced the results of its probe in June this year. The investigation team has found four causes -- defective battery protection systems, improper operation of energy storage systems, faulty installation of the systems and a lack of an overall control unit.The two companies have come up with the safety measures due to a sense of crisis that they might lose the emerging global ESS market if the domestic ESS ecosystem collapses.Samsung SDI said it would invest up to 200 billion won (US$168.71 million) to strengthen the safety of its ESS products. LG Chem has not revealed a specific amount but industry watchers expect that the firm will spend 100 billion won (US$84.35 million) to enhance the safety of its products.Samsung SDI said it has developed a special fire extinguishing system for ESS. Its new system is made of special chemicals and fire blocking materials that can extinguish flames quickly and prevent fires from spreading even if one battery cell is caught on fire, it claimed. The company will introduce the special fire extinguishing system in new products and apply it to some 1,000 existing ESS operation sites in South Korea on its own expense.Samsung SDI has been installing impact-detecting sensors in the ESS products that have already been deployed for the past year on its own expense.LG Chem has also unveiled its measures, including conditional recall plans. The company has developed a product that prevents fires from spreading and will launch it in the near future. As part of its measures, the company said it will limit the operation rate of ESS systems that include batteries produced in its Nanjing plant in China in 2017 to 70 percent and cover the losses to the ESS operators.In addition, LG Chem will identify the cause of previous fires by the end of this year through a precise analysis and come up with active alternative plans, such as the replacement of products, even if it fails to find the exact cause for fires. During a recent parliamentary inspection, Kim Joon-ho, vice president of LG Chem, said, ‚ÄúWe will issue a recall if our batteries that were manufactured in the Nanjing plant in China in 2017 become a problem overseas.‚ÄùOf the 23 fires that have broken out since August 2017, 14 involved ESS made by LG Chem, while nine took place at business sites that used Samsung SDI‚Äôs energy systems. Three additional ESS fires occurred after the government announced the results of joint investigation in June. Out of the three, two involved ESS produced by LG Chem and one a Samsung SDI product.Until now, it has not yet been confirmed that batteries manufactured by the two firms were defective. The government‚Äôs investigation team cited complex causes, including defective battery protection systems.Samsung SDI and LG Chem are held accountable for the fires, even though their batteries have not been found defective. In particular, the two companies shipped the same batteries to other countries but not a single ESS fire case has been reported in other countries. Therefore, they note that it is hard to say the cause of the fires was defects in batteries.After a controversy arose over ESS fires, the two companies suffered a sharp drop in their receipts of ESS orders. Market experts express concerns that the industry has shrunken due to the controversy over fires before the new ESS market has grown to a certain level and battery producers are suffering damage.In this regard, SNE Research said the global ESS lithium-ion battery market will grow 38 percent compared to the previous year. The size of the market will increase from 11.6 GWh in 2018 to 16 GWh in 2019. It also expects that the figure will rise to 86.9 GWh in 2025. South Korean battery manufacturers are fettered by the controversy over fires, though the global market is rapidly growing.",

        "European Commission opens investigation into proposed public support for Samsung SDI battery plant in Hungary ": "\nThe European Commission has opened an in-depth investigation to assess whether Hungary's plans to grant ‚Ç¨108 million of public support to Samsung SDI for investing in the expansion of its battery cell production facility in G√∂d (Hungary) is in line with EU rules on regional State aid.\nPublic investment is important to foster economic growth in disadvantaged regions in Europe. But public support should only be given if it‚Äôs necessary to trigger private investment in the disadvantaged region concerned. Otherwise, it only gives the beneficiary an unfair advantage over its competitors, at the expense of taxpayers. The Commission will carefully investigate whether Hungary‚Äôs planned support is really necessary for Samsung SDI to invest in G√∂d, is kept to the minimum necessary and does not distort competition or harm cohesion in the EU.‚ÄîCommissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy\nSamsung SDI is one of the main players in the fast growing market of lithium-ion battery market. Samsung SDI is investing around ‚Ç¨1.2 billion to expand the production capacity of lithium-ion cells and battery packs for electric vehicles in its existing plant located in G√∂d. The work on the capacity expansion started in December 2017, and the implementation of the project is now well advanced. In 2018, Hungary notified the Commission of its plans to grant ‚Ç¨108 million of public support for the project.\n\nEU State aid rules, in particular the Commission's 2014 Regional State Aid Guidelines, enable Member States to support economic development and employment in the EU‚Äôs disadvantaged regions and to foster regional cohesion in the Single Market. In order to be approved, the measures need to fulfil certain conditions to make sure that they have the intended positive effect. This includes that the support must incentivise private investment, be kept to the minimum necessary, must not lure away investment from a region in another Member State which is as or more disadvantaged (anti-cohesion effect) and must not be directly causing the relocation of activities (such as jobs) to the Member State granting the support from elsewhere in the EU.\n\nThe Commission has doubts at this stage that the planned aid support of ‚Ç¨108 million to Samsung SDI in G√∂d complies with all relevant criteria of the Regional Aid Guidelines:\nthe Commission has doubts whether the measure has an ‚Äúincentive effect‚Äù. In this respect, the Commission will investigate whether the decision by Samsung SDI to invest in Hungary was directly triggered by the Hungarian public support, in line with the conditions set out in the Guidelines or whether the investment would have been carried out in G√∂d, even absent the public support;the Commission also has doubts in relation to the public support's contribution to regional development and on its appropriateness and proportionality; andthe Commission cannot exclude at this stage that the public support may lead to the relocation of jobs from other EU Member States to Hungary.\nThe Commission will now investigate further to determine whether or not the initial concerns are confirmed. The opening of an in-depth investigation provides Hungary and interested third parties with an opportunity to comment on the measure. It does not prejudge in any way the outcome of the investigation.\nPosted on 16 October 2019 in Batteries, Europe, Policy, Regulations  | Permalink\n | \nComments (0)\n\n\tThe comments to this entry are closed.\nMore...",

Image: Younicos (Aggreko). Lithium-ion battery manufacturer Samsung SDI has claimed an industry first, passing UL9540A test certification for the safe installation of stationary energy storage systems (ESS), with particular regard to the fire risk posed by thermal runaway.The South Korean company is supplier to many system integrators in the energy storage industry, as well as contributing to the manufacture of complete systems for commercial and utility use in a joint venture (JV) with inverter maker Sungrow.UL published UL 9540A, Test Method for Evaluating Thermal Runaway Fire Propagation in Battery Energy Storage Systems in 2018, ‚Äúto help manufacturers have a means of proving compliance,‚Äù to new regulations. These include standards introduced by the US National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), as well as changes to the International Fire Code currently in place (2018 IFC). Information on the UL test and methodology can be found here.For instance, meeting the terms of UL9540A can allow ESS racks to be installed in closer proximity to one another than the NFPA‚Äôs code 855 states, with UL9540A acting as assurance of safety. Meeting the test criteria also means battery racks ‚Äúcan be installed without needing to add separate fire-fighting system(s),‚Äù Samsung SDI said in a release sent today to Energy-Storage.news.UL9540A testing is applied to rack-level safety with an optional battery system safety test. Samsung SDI is the first to meet the rack-level requirements. Samsung SDI said it attained the certification ‚Äúfor its capability of preventing large scale fire in the ESS by applying proprietary designs for safety of cells, modules and racks to prevent battery thermal runaway propagation‚Äù.As reported by Energy-Storage.news over the past few months, investigations into a couple of dozen¬†lithium-ion battery storage system fires across South Korea in 2018 showed that rather than defective battery cells, poor installation, monitoring or management of battery systems was to blame in every case.
