    "https://www.threeifbyspace.net/2020/03/review-radiant-season-1-part-2-blu-ray-release/": "In the world of Shonen anime, there are more than enough strong main characters to stand out that many new ones become muted in their shadow. Radiant doesn’t sound all that special when you read about its premise. “The world is overrun with monsters called Nemesis—and a young boy infected by them will stop at nothing to defeat them all!“. Sounds like your typical Shonen anime right? Wrong. Lets dive into what makes Radiant different. First, we will give you some background and a sneak preview.Evil creatures called Nemeses fall from the skies and the only ones who can fight them are Wizards—infected ones who survived a Nemesis’s corruption. Seth, one of these survivors, vows not only to fight the Nemeses, but to find their mythical nest, Radiant, and destroy it!Seth has big goals of defeating Nemeses, but first he must earn the trust of the very villagers he wants to protect—not an easy task when those who use magic are just as feared as the Nemeses they fight. Even worse, Seth can barely control his monstrous powers! It’ll take more than brute strength—although it’ll take that too—to get Seth’s quest out of the boonies and into the big time!The limited-edition release of the second half of season 1 for Radiant includes a chipboard box that houses both parts of season 1. The box cover has the title character, Seth, on one side with the Radiant logo. The other side shows the Inquisition in the background with Seth and an unknown character standing back to back.The set includes 13 episodes on 2 blu-ray discs and 2 DVDs. You also get a digital copy that you can download. As part of the limited-edition release, you also get an 80-page hardcover art book, 2 keychains and a set of art cards.Founder and managing editor for Three If By Space.

    "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/anime-like-radiant/": "Adapted from Tony Valente’s French Manfra of the same name, ‘Radiant’ has a massive cast of well-developed characters, a meticulously devised world, and incredible production. Although it had a rough start when its first season premiered back in 2018, with its second season, ‘Radiant’ has now shunned all the hate surrounding it with the depth of its storyline. But for all its hype and worth, ‘Radiant’ is still not unique and has a lot of similarities with other shounen out there. So here’s a list of all the anime that you might enjoy watching if you like ‘Radiant‘. Most of the anime mentioned in the list below are available on Funimation, Crunchyroll or Hulu.\nJust like ‘Radiant’, ‘UQ Holder’ is set in a world where the whole idea of magic is new to most people and that’s the reason why they look at it with skepticism. Unlike Radiant, the main character of ‘UQ Holder’ is not considered to be an outcast just because of his magical abilities but he, too, struggles to make a name for himself in a world where his uncanny powers make him a minority. Also, ‘UQ Holder’ is a very loyal adaptation of its source manga whereas ‘Radiant’ often makes changes to the original storyline.‘The Legend of the Legendary Heroes’ revolves around a lazy mage named Ryner Lute who possesses the Alpha Stigma, a mark on his forehead which takes control over his body and forces him to do things he doesn’t want to do. Because of this uncontrollable ability, he often ends up killing anyone he gets close to. But later, he joins forces with a swordswoman and a king to finally put his ability to good use and bring peace in the world he lives in.For the most part, ‘The Legend of the Legendary Heroes’ is less of a shounen and more of a fantasy anime show. However, it does share a lot of world-building elements and shounen tropes with ‘Radiant’. Even the magic system of the two anime is quite similar. Moreover, the protagonists of both the anime are initially feared because of their unique magic abilities but when they put these abilities to good use, they get the respect they deserve.Asta and Yuno are two young boys who were abandoned at the Church. After growing up together, both of them started sharing the common dream of becoming the demon king someday. As they grew up, Yuno started to show some promising magic skills while Asta tried his best to show off but never really managed to outshine Yuno. Because of his skills, Yuno ends up getting a Grimoire with a four-leaf clover while Asta gets nothing at all. However, one day, when Yuno gets attacked by a former magic knight, everything changes. Just to save his friend from the Knight, Asta ends up unleashing all of his magical abilities and with this, he and Yuno embark on an adventure to fulfill their dream of becoming the greatest mage of their village.Unlike ‘Radiant’, where magic practitioners are often looked upon, magic is more of a necessity in the world of ‘Black Clover.’ But because of that, just like Seth, even Asta and Yuno turn out to be misfits among their people. Both the shows also follow a very typical shounen-styled storyline which can get a little predictable at times,  but their main appeal lies in their epic battle scenes. From a character development standpoint, ‘Black Clover’ has more depth but Radiant’s comedy is far more enjoyable.In the world of ‘Blue Exorcist’, humans and demons don’t get along too well and exist in two different realms. The only way demons can exist in the human realm is by possessing humans on the other side. Satan, who is the ruler of the demon realm, fails to find a suitable host and is forced to stay trapped in his own realm. That’s when he gets an idea. Instead of going to the human realm himself, he sends his own son there and hopes that he’ll grow up to fulfill his dream of ruling humans.Rin Okumura is the demon’s son who initially lives a fairly ordinary life in the human world until one day, he is ambushed by several demons and is told what is expected from him. However, he chooses to defy his father and instead of conquering the human world, he vows to become an exorcist and protect it from evil forces. Just like Seth from ‘Radiant’, Rin seems to be somewhat of a troublesome teenager but he later proves that there’s a lot more to him than just that. The protagonists of both the shows are initially distrusted by the ones who surround them because of how different they are. But much later, they’re both able to prove that they only intend to protect humans from dark forces.Read More: Radiant Season 3© 2020 Cinemaholic Inc. All rights reserved.

    "https://simplywall.st/stocks/tw/healthcare/gtsm-3373/radiant-innovation-shares/news/a-rising-share-price-has-us-looking-closely-at-radiant-innovation-inc-s-gtsm3373-p-e-ratio-2/": " Radiant Innovation (GTSM:3373) shares have continued recent momentum with a 33% gain in the last month alone. Zooming out, the annual gain of 197% knocks our socks off.  Assuming no other changes, a sharply higher share price makes a stock less attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that deep value investors might steer clear when expectations of a company are too high. One way to gauge market expectations of a stock is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E ratio means that investors have a high expectation about future growth, while a low P/E ratio means they have low expectations about future growth.  View our latest analysis for Radiant Innovation  We can tell from its P/E ratio of 79.09 that there is some investor optimism about Radiant Innovation. The image below shows that Radiant Innovation has a significantly higher P/E than the average (18.0) P/E for companies in the medical equipment industry.  That means that the market expects Radiant Innovation will outperform other companies in its industry. The market is optimistic about the future, but that doesn’t guarantee future growth. So investors should delve deeper. I like to check if company insiders have been buying or selling.  Companies that shrink earnings per share quickly will rapidly decrease the ‘E’ in the equation. That means unless the share price falls, the P/E will increase in a few years. So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.  Radiant Innovation’s 101% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. Regrettably, the longer term performance is poor, with EPS down 8.3% per year over 5 years.  The ‘Price’ in P/E reflects the market capitalization of the company. Thus, the metric does not reflect cash or debt held by the company. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.  While growth expenditure doesn’t always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.  The extra options and safety that comes with Radiant Innovation’s NT$222m net cash position means that it deserves a higher P/E than it would if it had a lot of net debt.  Radiant Innovation’s P/E is 79.1 which suggests the market is more focussed on the future opportunity rather than the current level of earnings. Its net cash position is the cherry on top of its superb EPS growth. So based on this analysis we’d expect Radiant Innovation to have a high P/E ratio. What we know for sure is that investors have become much more excited about Radiant Innovation recently, since they have pushed its P/E ratio from 59.3 to 79.1 over the last month. For those who prefer to invest with the flow of momentum, that might mean it’s time to put the stock on a watchlist, or research it. But the contrarian may see it as a missed opportunity.  When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. If the reality for a company is better than it expects, you can make money by buying and holding for the long term. Although we don’t have analyst forecasts shareholders might want to examine this detailed historical graph of earnings, revenue and cash flow.
