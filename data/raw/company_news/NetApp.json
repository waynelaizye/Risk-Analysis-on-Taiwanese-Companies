        "Who Has Been Selling NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) Shares? – Simply Wall St News": "\n  It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares.\n  On the other hand, we’d be remiss not to mention that insider sales have been known to precede tough periods for a business.\n  So before you buy or sell NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.\n\n  It is perfectly legal for company insiders, including board members, to buy and sell stock in a company.\n  However, such insiders must disclose their trading activities, and not trade on inside information.\n\n  Insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing.\n  But it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.\n  For example, a Columbia University study found that ‘insiders are more likely to engage in open market purchases of their own company’s stock when the firm is about to reveal new agreements with customers and suppliers’.\n\n\n\n        Check out our latest analysis for NetApp\n      \n\n\n\nOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by Executive VP & General Manager Joel Reich for US$2.0m worth of shares, at about US$78.04 per share.\n      So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$65.26.\n      While their view may have changed since the sale, this is not a particularly positive fact.\n      We generally tread carefully if insiders have been selling on market, even if they sold slightly above the current price.\n  Joel Reich was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.\n\n \n\nJoel Reich ditched 62.27k shares over the year. The average price per share was US$75.10.\nYou can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.\nIf you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\n    I will like NetApp better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.\n\n  I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders.\n  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.\n  \n  \n    It appears that NetApp insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$18m.\n    While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it’s enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.\n\n\n    There haven’t been any insider transactions in the last three months — that doesn’t mean much.\n\n        Our analysis of NetApp insider transactions leaves us cautious.\n      But it’s good to see that insiders own shares in the company.\n\n\n  If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.\n\n \n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.  \nWe aim to bring you long-term focused research analysis driven by fundamental data.

        "What Does NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) Share Price Indicate? – Simply Wall St News": "\n\n    \n\n      Let’s talk about the popular NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP). The company’s shares\n\n    \n\n    \n      \n      saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months.\n\n      \n      \n        \n       \n        With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price.\n\n        However, what if the stock is still a bargain?\n\n        Today I will analyse the most recent data on NetApp’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\n        \n\n      \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n        Check out our latest analysis for NetApp\n      \n\n\nWant to participate in a short research study?

Since NetApp’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.\n\n          \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    What does the future of NetApp look like?\n  \n\n\n\n\nNASDAQGS:NTAP Future Profit January 30th 19\n\n\n\n  Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.\n\n  Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company’s future expectations.\n\n    \n\n      \n\n        With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NetApp. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.\n\n      \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nAre you a shareholder?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tIt seems like the market has already priced in NTAP’s positive outlook,\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\twith shares trading around its fair value.

        "NetApp CEO: Company Misses Revenue Expectations, But Flash, Cloud Lay Ground For Future Growth": "NetApp CEO George Kurian blames macroeconomic factors for the revenue miss in the quarter, but said strong operational and gross margins show that the company's flash, hybrid cloud and cloud data services strategies are leading the way to growth. A focus on three key new product areas gave NetApp strong margins and earnings for its third quarter fiscal 2019, but that did not provide much support for revenue growth. NetApp Wednesday said its flash storage, private cloud and cloud data services businesses were great for the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company's bottom line, but that headwinds from macroeconomic factors kept revenue growth below expectations.  By focusing on the variables it could control, NetApp enjoyed strong operational margins and gross margins during the quarter and provided a path for future growth, said CEO George Kurian. \n[Related: NetApp's All-Flash Storage Array Sales Take Crown From Dell EMC]  \"Regardless of the headwinds, we remain confident in the future,\" Kurian said during prepared remarks for NetApp's quarterly financial analyst conference call. Kurian cited macroeconomic conditions outside the company's control, including trade concerns, as headwinds during the quarter. \"[But] we did not see any real change in the competitive environment,\" he said.  When asked by an analyst why Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins did not seem to see any macroeconomic issues in Cisco's second quarter fiscal 2019 results, which were also reported Wednesday, Kurian said he was unable to comment on that. \"I'll leave that to Chuck,\" he said.  As customers continue their digital transformation and look for ways to generate new insight based on data, Kurian said NetApp is the only company able to meet the three top customer imperatives including the shift from disk-based storage to flash storage, the shift from traditional IT to private cloud, and the shift from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid cloud. \"It is in these three strategic battlegrounds that we have substantial opportunity to exploit the advantages created by the NetApp Data Fabric and take share,\" he said.  NetApp is helping drive the market transition to flash storage and saw its flash storage business grow 19 percent over last year to an annual run rate of $2.4 billion, Kurian said. At the same time, NetApp has ensured that all its flash storage comes with built-in cloud connectivity, he said. For now, Kurian said, only 15 percent of NetApp's large installed base has added flash to the mix. \"The run rate for this market is still in the early innings,\" he said.  When asked by an analyst how flash sales to that installed base as a percentage will grow, Kurian said there is much opportunity to grow,  even as the percentage of NetApp's installed base adopt flash grows so does its installed base as a whole, which means it will take time to see the overall percentage grow. \"We're seeing both the numerator and denominator grow,\" he said.  In the shift from traditional IT to private cloud, NetApp continues to introduce new artificial intelligence and flash technologies, including technology that accelerates workflows with flash connections to public cloud storage, Kurian said. \"As a result, the momentum in our private cloud business accelerated in the third quarter,\" he said.  In the shift from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid cloud, NetApp has placed a huge focus on its new cloud data services business, Kurian said. For the third quarter, NetApp saw what Kurian called a $33 million annual revenue run rate, which was up 22 percent over the second quarter. And, he said, two-thirds of that came from customers who are net-new to NetApp.  That is making this year a fundamental year for NetApp's cloud data services business, Kurian said. \"While still in the early phases, we are well positioned for when these services become widely available,\" he said. When asked by an analyst how the announcement by Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy that AWS is bringing file-based services to its public cloud offering might impact NetApp's ability to grow its cloud business, Kurian said NetApp continues to see real uptake in its Cloud Volumes on AWS offering. \"I'm sure [Jassy] has his offerings, but we continue to see growth,\" he said.  About 80 percent of NetApp's revenue comes through indirect channels, a percentage that has been stable for some time, Kurian said. For its third fiscal quarter 2019, NetApp reported revenue of $1.56 billion, up about 2 percent from the $1.54 billion the company reported in its third fiscal quarter 2018.  Income on a GAAP basis for the quarter reached $249 million, or 98 cents per share, compared with last year's GAAP  loss of $479 million, or $1.79 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, NetApp reported income of $305 million, or $1.20 per share, compared with last year's $289 million, or $1.05 per share. The company did change how it reported its financials this quarter after adopting the Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASC 606 accounting rules, and restated prior results to match the new rules.  Analysts had been expecting revenue of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.15, according to Seeking Alpha. Looking forward, NetApp provided revenue guidance for its fourth quarter fiscal 2019 of $1.59 billion to $1.69 billion, which at the halfway point of $1.64 billion is flat with fourth quarter fiscal 2018. NetApp also said it expects next quarter's earnings per share on a GAAP basis of $1.06 to $1.12 compared with last   ear's 99 cents per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $1.22 to $1.28 per share compared with last year's $1.05 per share. Analysts had been expecting fourth-quarter guidance of $1.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.25, according to Seeking Alpha.  NetApp reported its financials after the close of trading  Wednesday. In after-hours trading, share prices hovered for several hours down about 7 percent over closing prices.NetApp's CloudJumper Buy Will Tie VDI, Storage, Cloud: PartnersCommvault Accuses Rubrik, Cohesity Of Patent InfringementCohesity Closes $250 Million Funding Round, Including Support From HPE, CiscoKomprise Unveils Elastic Data Migration To Move Data Between On-Premises, CloudRubrik Taps ServiceNow CMO As Its First PresidentCognizant: Some Employee Email Access Lost After Maze AttackCognizant Left With ‘No Good Options’ After Maze Attack: Security ExpertHPE’s Antonio Neri: ‘Returning To The Office Will Be Voluntary’Cognizant Breach: 10 Things To Know About Maze Ransomware AttacksCoronavirus Relief: HPE, Aruba Suspend Partner Ready Revenue Targets ",
        "Why NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) High P/E Ratio Isn’t Necessarily A Bad Thing – Simply Wall St News": "\nWant to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!\n\n    This article is for investors who would like to improve their understanding of price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). \n    To keep it practical, we’ll show how NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. \n    Based on the last twelve months, NetApp’s P/E ratio is 58.78.\n    That is equivalent to an earnings yield of about 1.7%.\n\n  \n\n\n        See our latest analysis for NetApp\n      \n\n\n  The formula for P/E is:\n\n  Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS)\n\nOr for NetApp:\n \nP/E of 58.78 = $65.93 ÷ $1.12 \n  (Based on the year to October 2018.)\n\n\n  A higher P/E ratio means that investors are paying a higher price for each $1 of company earnings.\n  That is not a good or a bad thing per se, but a high P/E does imply buyers are optimistic about the future.\n\n    When earnings fall, the ‘E’ decreases, over time.\n    Therefore, even if you pay a low multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become higher in the future.\n    So while a stock may look cheap based on past earnings, it could be expensive based on future earnings.\n\n    NetApp shrunk earnings per share by 53% over the last year.\n    \n    \n    \n      And it has shrunk its earnings per share by 14% per year over the last five years.\n      This could justify a pessimistic P/E.\n\n  The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company.\n    The image below shows that NetApp has a significantly higher P/E than the average (16.1) P/E for companies in the tech industry.\n\n    That means that the market expects NetApp will outperform other companies in its industry.\n\n\n  Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain.\n  So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.\n\n  It’s important to note that the P/E ratio considers the market capitalization, not the enterprise value.\n  In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet.\n  Hypothetically, a company could reduce its future P/E ratio by spending its cash (or taking on debt) to achieve higher earnings.\n\n  Such expenditure might be good or bad, in the long term, but the point here is that the balance sheet is not reflected by this ratio.\n\n    Since NetApp holds net cash of US$2.5b, it can spend on growth, justifying a higher P/E ratio than otherwise.\n\n  \n    NetApp has a P/E of 58.8. That’s significantly higher than the average in the US market, which is 16.8.\n    \n    \n      \n        Falling earnings per share is probably keeping traditional value investors away,\n        but the relatively strong balance sheet will allow the company time to invest in growth. Clearly, the high P/E indicates shareholders think it will!\n      \n    \n\n  \n\n  Investors should be looking to buy stocks that the market is wrong about.\n\n    As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.’\n\n\n    So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold they key to an excellent investment decision.\n\n\nOf course you might be able to find a better stock than NetApp. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have grown earnings strongly. \nTo help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

        "Is NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) CEO Salary Justified? – Simply Wall St News": "\n      George Kurian has been the CEO of NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) since 2015.\n\n        This report will, first, examine the CEO compensation levels in comparison to CEO compensation at other big companies.\n\n    Next, we’ll consider growth that the business demonstrates.\n\n    Third, we’ll reflect on the total return to shareholders over three years, as a second measure of business performance.\n\n    This process should give us an idea about how appropriately the CEO is paid.\n  \n\n\n        Check out our latest analysis for NetApp\n      \n\nWant to help shape the future of investing tools and platforms? Take the survey and be part of one of the most advanced studies of stock market investors to date.\n  According to our data, NetApp, Inc. has a market capitalization of US$15b, and pays its CEO total annual compensation worth US$13m.\n    (This number is for the twelve months until 2018).\n    We think total compensation is more important but we note that the CEO salary is lower, at US$925k.\n    We took a group of companies with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, and calculated the median CEO compensation to be US$11m.\n    There aren’t very many mega-cap companies, so we had to take a wide range to get a meaningful comparison figure.\n\n    So George Kurian receives a similar amount to the median CEO pay, amongst the companies we looked at.\n\n    While this data point isn’t particularly informative alone, it gains more meaning when considered with business performance.\n\n    You can see, below, how CEO compensation at NetApp has changed over time.\n\n    NetApp, Inc. has reduced its earnings per share by an average of 9.3% a year, over the last three years.\n\n    In the last year, its revenue is up 9.7%.\n\n  \n      Unfortunately, earnings per share have trended lower over the last three years.\n\n      And the modest revenue growth over 12 months isn’t much comfort against the reduced earnings per share.\n\n    These factors suggest that the business performance wouldn’t really justify a high pay packet for the CEO.\n  \n\n\n      It could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.\n  \n    Boasting a total shareholder return of 204% over three years, NetApp, Inc. has done well by shareholders.\n\n    As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.\n    \n   George Kurian is paid around what is normal the leaders of larger companies.\n\n            The company isn’t growing earnings per share, but shareholder returns have been strong over the last three years.\n            So we doubt many are complaining about the fairly normal CEO pay.\n            \n\nWhatever your view on compensation, you might want to check if insiders are buying or selling NetApp shares (free trial). \n\nOr you might rather take a peek at this analytical visualization of historic cash flow, earnings and revenue.\n  \nTo help readers see past the short term volatility of the financial market, we aim to bring you a long-term focused research analysis purely driven by fundamental data.

(NASDAQ:NTAP), a large-cap worth US$16b.\n\n    Risk-averse investors who are attracted to diversified streams of revenue and strong capital returns tend to seek out these large companies.\n\n    However,\n\n    the key to their continued success lies in its financial health.\n\n    This article will examine NetApp’s financial liquidity and debt levels to get an idea of whether the company can deal with cyclical downturns and maintain funds to accommodate strategic spending for future growth.\n\n    Note that this information is centred entirely on financial health and is a high-level overview, so I encourage you to look further\n\n    into NTAP here.\n  \n\n\n        See our latest analysis for NetApp\n      \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Over the past year, NTAP has reduced its debt from US$2.2b to US$1.7b\n\n\n          , which also accounts for long term debt.\n\n\n      With this\n\n      debt repayment,\n\n\n\n  \n\n    NTAP currently has US$4.1b remaining in cash and short-term investments\n\n    , ready to deploy into the business.\n\n      \n\n        Moreover,\n\n        NTAP has\n\n        generated\n\n        cash from operations of US$1.4b\n\n        in the last twelve months,\n\n        leading to\n\n        an operating cash to total debt ratio of 84%,\n\n        signalling that\n\n\n            NTAP’s\n\n            current level of operating cash is high enough to cover debt.\n\n\n        This ratio can also be interpreted as a measure of efficiency\n\n\n            as an alternative to return on assets.\n\n\n        In NTAP’s case, it is able to generate 0.84x cash from its debt capital.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  At the current liabilities level of US$3.4b,\n\n  the company\n\n  \n    has maintained a safe level of current assets to meet its obligations, with the current ratio last standing at 1.56x.\n\n    \n      For Tech companies, this ratio is within a sensible range\n\n      since there’s a sufficient cash cushion without leaving too much capital idle or in low-earning investments.\n\n    \n\n  \n\n  \n\n    \n\n      Considering NetApp’s total debt outweighs its equity, the company is deemed highly levered.\n\n      This is not unusual for large-caps since debt tends to be less expensive than equity because interest payments are tax deductible.\n\n      Accordingly, large companies often have lower cost of capital due to easily obtained financing, providing an advantage over smaller companies.\n\n        \n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n            NTAP’s high cash coverage means that, although its debt levels are high, the company is able to utilise its borrowings efficiently in order to generate cash flow.\n\n            This may mean this is an optimal capital structure for the business, given that it is also meeting its short-term commitment.\n\n            I admit this is a fairly basic analysis for NTAP’s financial health. Other important fundamentals need to be considered alongside.\n\n            I suggest you\n\n            continue to research NetApp to get a\n\n            more holistic view\n\n            of the large-cap by looking at:\n\n          \n\nFuture Outlook: What are well-informed industry analysts predicting for NTAP’s future growth?

        "\n      \n    How NetApp Successfully Completed a Business Turnaround ": "Returns as of 5/1/2020Returns as of 5/1/2020Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) has been around since the 1990's, when it primarily sold on-premise computer storage solutions. The company has reinvented itself as a cloud computing software business. In doing so, NetApp has orchestrated an epic business turnaround that has delivered real results for shareholders.Image source: NetApp.NetApp received seed financing from the legendary venture capital fund Sequoia and had its initial public offering in 1995. The company was founded as a network storage company, which sold hardware packaged with proprietary software. NetApp's stock flew to astronomical levels during the tech bubble where, despite merely generating revenue of $579 million in 2000, NTAP's stock achieved a market capitalization of nearly $50 billion. 19 years later, the stock price still hasn't recovered to those levels, serving as quite the lesson in financial excess!NTAP Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsDespite the popping of the internet bubble, NetApp was a real business and continued to grow at a steady clip for the next decade. Around 2010, NetApp's business was disrupted by cloud computing companies. The world woke up one day and decided that cloud computing was the future. Unfortunately, NetApp failed to keep up with the innovators and revenue declined.Check out the latest earnings call transcript for NetApp.Recognizing a need for change, NetApp appointed George Kurian as CEO in 2015. Since his appointment, Kurian has led a remarkable turnaround. The company invested heavily in research and development. Between 2015 and 2018, NetApp invested over $3.3 billion in research and development or roughly 14.5% of total revenue over that time period. Furthermore, NetApp embarked on a significant restructuring which resulted in over 4% of employees being laid off.Most importantly, NetApp studied the new competition and adapted. The company embarked on a massive product refresh cycle. While many competitors focused on being a provider for public or private clouds, NetApp released a flexible solution that lets customers choose to operate on a public, private, or hybrid cloud. Their software works with all major cloud products including Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google cloud.As a result of the company's intense focus on innovation, NetApp released industry-leading products. Gartner has named NetApp the #1 product in three categories: storage operating system, storage & device management software, and commercial storage for OpenStack. Customers have responded by buying NetApp's products over other vendors. NetApp is growing at a faster rate than industry peers and is taking market share.The turnaround has resulted in revenue growth and higher margins which has translated into significant earnings growth. Being a software company, NetApp has little need to invest in capital expenditures. Therefore, earnings have mostly converted into cash flow.NTAP Operating Income (TTM) data by YChartsNetApp has used its growing cash flow to pay dividends, repurchase shares, and make strategic acquisitions. Its stock carries a dividend yield of 2.4%, and the company has repurchased nearly $4 billion in stock since 2015. The company has made a handful of modestly sized acquisitions, mostly acquiring interesting technology which it can bolt-on to its existing suite of products.NTAP data by YChartsNetApp's turnaround has resulted in positive financial results. The company has returned much of its growing cash flow to shareholders, and the market has responded by sending the stock higher. NetApp and its management team have clearly done a great job and have been rewarded for it.NetApp's turnaround is a good case study. Many companies respond to depressed stock prices by focusing on cost-cutting and share repurchases. Although by no means did NetApp's recovery occur overnight, the company demonstrated that an operational turnaround is achievable by investing in R&D and focusing on product innovation. While NetApp has been able to cut costs and return capital to shareholders, its stock price did not recover until revenue and earnings started to grow again.Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

        "Is It Time To Consider Buying NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)? – Simply Wall St News": " NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NASDAQGS, rising to highs of $77.69 and falling to the lows of $63.19. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NetApp’s current trading price of $67.79 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NetApp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!    Check out our latest analysis for NetApp    According to my valuation model, NetApp seems to be fairly priced at around 1.7% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy NetApp today, you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $68.93, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since NetApp’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.  Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for NetApp. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.  Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in NTAP’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?  Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NTAP, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.  Price is just the tip of the iceberg.

        "\n      \n    NetApp's Recent Earnings Stumble May Lead to a Buying Opportunity ": "Returns as of 5/1/2020Returns as of 5/1/2020Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Shares of on-site and cloud-based storage hybrid NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) are down over 20% from recent highs after the company reported end-of-year results last week for its 2019 fiscal year (the 12 months ended April 26, 2019). Management cited issues with sales execution as well as foreign currency exchange rates that went against them. Nevertheless, the enterprise storage company has made a lot of headway over the last few years, and the stock has tripled since the beginning of 2016. Headwinds to progress have mounted, but the reset on expectations might be just what value investors were hoping for.First, the bad news. NetApp CEO George Kurian expressed disappointment in how the company finished out its fiscal year. Business renewals with existing customers under-performed internal expectations in the fourth quarter, and the company's original equipment manufacturing (OEM) segment declined and is not expected to rebound. Though OEM is a small portion of the whole, Kurian said the poor showing will have a negative impact over the next 12 months. Additionally, data-center deals are taking longer to develop than in the recent past. NetApp is going to funnel more money toward its sales efforts to help with execution, but a slower sales cycle appears to be the new norm. Paired with a stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies during the last year, NetApp's final results didn't quite measure up to expectations. Metric12 Months Ending April 26, 201812 Months Ending April 27, 2019Increase (YOY)Revenue$5.91 billion$6.15 billion4%Gross profit margin63.5%65%1.5 p.p.Adjusted earnings per share$3.56$4.5227%Data source: NetApp. YOY = year over year. The good news is that, despite the sluggish top line, NetApp's profitability continues to soar. High profit margin on new product and solutions -- especially for the data center and cloud segments -- is translating into double-digit earnings growth when adjusting for one-time items. Those bottom-line increases are getting put to work in the form of a dividend (which was hiked by 20%, now good for a 3.2% annual yield) and share buybacks (which totaled $500 million in the last year alone, representing 3.3% of the company's total current market cap). That is some serious return of value to shareholders. Image source: Getty Images.NetApp's top team told investors to expect more sluggish top-line gains, somewhere in the low- to mid-single-digits in the year ahead. Nevertheless, because of strong profit margins, management said it thinks another double-digit rise in earnings is doable -- this time in the low teens before accounting for more share repurchases. That's a decent outlook. So why the negative reaction by shareholders?For one, the digital memory industry is still overall in a slump that may not end for at least a couple more quarters. It's also worth noting that NetApp shares could suffer along with other tech manufacturers after trade disagreements between the U.S. and China worsened. However, NetApp pointed out during its last earnings call that it has already altered its supply chain and does not expect tariffs to have an impact on results going forward. Well played, NetApp. What we're left with is one inexpensive stock. Industry headwinds haven't yet derailed the tech company -- at least according to the outlook -- and shares have been left trading at a humble 13.5 times trailing-12-month price to free cash flow. Shares are valued at 11.0 times price to earnings using one-year forward expected profits. That's inexpensive if the company can deliver another year of double-digit bottom-line expansion.With NetApp executing a solid strategy of returning cash to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases, a double-digit rise looks feasible. That's why now looks like a good time to give careful consideration to a buy-the-dip purchase. Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

        "Is It Smart To Buy NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) Before It Goes Ex": " Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!  Regular readers will know that we love our dividends at Simply Wall St, which is why it’s exciting to see NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 2 days. Investors can purchase shares before the 3rd of July in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 24th of July.  NetApp’s next dividend payment will be US$0.48 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$1.92 to shareholders. Based on the last year’s worth of payments, NetApp stock has a trailing yield of around 3.1% on the current share price of $61.7. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether NetApp’s dividend is reliable and sustainable. That’s why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing.    Check out our latest analysis for NetApp    Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. That’s why it’s good to see NetApp paying out a modest 35% of its earnings. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether NetApp generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It distributed 35% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.  It’s positive to see that NetApp’s dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.  Click  this link to see the company’s income payout ratio, plus what analysts are forecasting for its future payout ratio.  Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we’re glad to see NetApp’s earnings per share have risen 20% per annum over the last five years.  Earnings per share are growing rapidly and the company is keeping more than half of its earnings within the business; an attractive combination which could suggest the company is focused on reinvesting to grow earnings further. Fast-growing businesses that are reinvesting heavily are enticing from a dividend perspective, especially since they can often increase the payout ratio later.  Another key way to measure a company’s dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. NetApp has delivered an average of 21% per year annual increase in its dividend, based on the past 6 years of dividend payments. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.  Is NetApp worth buying for its dividend? NetApp has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. NetApp looks solid on this analysis overall, and we’d definitely consider investigating it more closely.  Curious what other investors think of NetApp?  See what analysts are forecasting, with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flow .

        "Have Insiders Been Selling NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) Shares? – Simply Wall St News": " Want to participate in a short research study? Help shape the future of investing tools and you could win a $250 gift card!  It is not uncommon to see companies perform well in the years after insiders buy shares. Unfortunately, there are also plenty of examples of share prices declining precipitously after insiders have sold shares. So before you buy or sell NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP), you may well want to know whether insiders have been buying or selling.  It’s quite normal to see company insiders, such as board members, trading in company stock, from time to time. However, rules govern insider transactions, and certain disclosures are required.  We don’t think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. For example, a Harvard University study found that ‘insider purchases earn abnormal returns of more than 6% per year.’    Check out our latest analysis for NetApp    In the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive VP & CFO, Ronald Pasek, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$58.49 per share. So it’s clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$61.46. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don’t know for sure what they think of the stock price. It is worth noting that this sale was only 42% of Ronald Pasek’s holding.  Over the last year, we note insiders sold 139k shares worth US$8.9m. In the last year NetApp insiders didn’t buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!  For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.  The last three months saw significant insider selling at NetApp. In total, insiders dumped US$6.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn’t record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it’s hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.  I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that NetApp insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$41m. We’ve certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.  Insiders sold NetApp shares recently, but they didn’t buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn’t show any insider buying. But since NetApp is profitable and growing, we’re not too worried by this. Insider ownership isn’t particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We’re in no rush to buy! Therefore, you should should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for NetApp.  Of course NetApp may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.  For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

        "NetApp's Stock Tumbles Post": "YoutubeNetApp&apos;s \n  (NTAP) - Get Report shares were plummeting on Thursday after the storage hardware and software giant shared disappointing results and quarterly guidance that were blamed on several factors. At the same time, NetApp did issue a somewhat better full-year outlook -- an outlook that its CEO says is attainable with the help of sales team changes and larger contributions from high-growth businesses. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, NetApp reported April quarter (fiscal fourth quarter) revenue of $1.59 billion (up 4% annually) and non-GAAP EPS of $1.22, missing consensus analyst estimates of $1.64 billion and $1.26, respectively. The company also guided for July quarter revenue of $1.315 billion to $1.465 billion and EPS of $0.78 to $0.86; that&apos;s below consensus estimates of $1.48 billion and $1.05, with the midpoint of the revenue outlook implying a 6% annual revenue drop.For the whole of fiscal 2020 (it ends in April 2020), NetApp is guiding for revenue to grow at the low end of \"[a] mid-single-digit range.\" In addition, CFO Ron Pasek said on NetApp&apos;s earnings call that the company is \"committed to delivering low-teens EPS growth\" before accounting for the impact of new stock buybacks, and that it has recently \"conducted workforce realignments.\" Relative to the company&apos;s reported fiscal 2019 numbers, pre-earnings consensus estimates implied 4% revenue growth and 11% EPS growth.As of the time of this article, NetApp&apos;s stock is down 10.4% in Thursday trading to $60.05, leaving them up just fractionally on the year. They now sport an enterprise value (market cap minus net cash) equal to less than 10 times a fiscal 2020 free cash flow (FCF) consensus estimate of $1.32 billion.Following the release of NetApp&apos;s report, I had another chance to talk with CEO George Kurian -- previously interviewed following NetApp&apos;s April, July and October quarterly reports in 2018 -- about his company&apos;s numbers, as well as his thoughts on several of NetApp&apos;s businesses.Here&apos;s a look at some of Kurian&apos;s remarks on topics of interest: When asked about NetApp&apos;s light quarterly guidance, Kurian said NetApp is seeing \"continued caution\" among customers with regards to large data center purchases. Some of this caution, he added, exists in regions where macro pressures are a concern. However -- at a time when public cloud infrastructure demand continues eating into sales of traditional enterprise servers and storage systems -- Kurian added that there are \"ongoing discussions about what part of the data center stays within the data center, and what part goes to the public cloud.\" Separately, on NetApp&apos;s call, Kurian said NetApp was inconsistent in its \"go-to-market execution\" in the April quarter, and is responding by overhauling its sales and distribution efforts. He also said NetApp didn&apos;t execute well on deal renewals, and that the part of its business that involves products sold by OEM partners fell significantly. \n Also mentioned during our talk: NetApp is dealing with tough annual comparisons in the July quarter, since year-ago revenue was up 12% annually with the help of $90 million worth of one-time enterprise license agreement (ELA) payments. In addition, Kurian observed forex swings (a problem for many U.S. multinationals) are expected to act as a 1.5-percentage-point headwind to revenue growth during the quarter.  Though its performance disappointed in the April quarter, with revenue growth slowing to 11% from the January quarter&apos;s 19%, Kurian remained upbeat about the ability of NetApp&apos;s all-flash storage array (AFA) business to be a growth driver in fiscal 2020. The annualized revenue run rate for NetApp&apos;s AFA products is now at $2.7 billion. \n Kurian also forecast another strong year for the various offerings referred to by NetApp as its private cloud solutions -- its modular SolidFire AFAs, its StorageGRID object storage solutions and its hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) offerings, which integrate server and storage capabilities. These products are collectively said to now have an annualized revenue run rate above $600 million, and to have recorded triple-digit revenue growth in each of the last three quarters.  NetApp&apos;s various \"cloud data services\" -- subscription-based offerings used to manage, secure, back up and optimize the performance and reliability of cloud storage assets -- grew strongly off a relatively small base. Their annualized recurring revenue (ARR) grew 55% sequentially to $51 million. \n Kurian says NetApp saw \"really strong performance\" for its Cloud Volumes storage management software on Amazon.com \n  (AMZN) - Get Report  and Microsoft&apos;s \n  (MSFT) - Get Report public clouds. He also forecast the general availability of Azure NetApp Files, a file system solution for Microsoft Azure, will provide another \"inflection point\" for the business, and mentioned NetApp is now directing more sales resources towards growing both its cloud data services and private cloud businesses.  Last year, Kurian said NetApp expects offerings running on public clouds to produce $400 million to $600 million in ARR by the end of fiscal 2021.  While cautioning that it&apos;s still early, Kurian mentioned NetApp is seeing some interest in the use of Intel&apos;s \n (INTC) - Get Report Optane next-gen memory -- it strikes a middle ground between DRAM and flash memory in terms of performance, density and cost -- to improve the performance of demanding workloads such as in-memory databases and the running of complex algorithms. In April, around the same time that Intel made Optane main memory modules (DIMMs) generally available, \nNetApp announced its systems would support Optane DIMMs via its MAX Data software, which leverages technology obtained in 2017 through the acquisition of startup Plexistor. \nAlong similar lines, Kurian says NetApp is seeing some momentum for software offerings used to back up data from popular cloud apps. The majority of this business is said to currently involve Microsoft&apos;s Office 365 platform, but Kurian noted NetApp is also seeing some \"early traction\" for its Salesforce.com \n  (CRM) - Get Report  backup solution.Ten months ago, NetApp announced a partnership with Chinese IT giant Lenovo that called for Lenovo to resell NetApp&apos;s products and for the companies to launch a Chinese storage joint venture. Kurian says the JV is now operational, and \"off to a good start.\" However, he adds there&apos;s \"more work to do\" when it comes to the partnership&apos;s OEM distribution efforts. \"I think what we recognized earlier than most is that to continue to be a viable player in the China market, you need to work with a local partner,\" Kurian said, while also talking up Lenovo&apos;s reach outside of China and calling the partnership a \"multi-year strategic relationship.\" \nWhen asked about NetApp&apos;s thinking regarding M&A, Kurian suggested NetApp will make additional moves to strengthen its cloud data services business. Recent deals that fit this description include the 2017 acquisition of cloud management software firm Greenqloud and the 2018 acquisition of Stackpoint, a provider of software used to manage deployments of app containers running the popular Kubernetes container orchestration software across cloud environments.\"I think you&apos;ll see a lot more from us [in terms of] looking at new ways to enable data services in the public clouds, and there will be acquisitions to support that over time,\" he said.Amazon.com, Microsoft and Salesforce.com are holdings in Jim Cramer&apos;s Action Alerts PLUS member club.

In a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, NetApp reported income of $396 million, or $1.59 a share, on sales of $1.59 billion, down from $1.64 billion the year before. After adjusting for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges and other effects, the company reported earnings of $1.22 a share. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of $1.26 a share on sales of $1.64 billion, according to FactSet. NetApp said it expects first-quarter adjusted earnings of 78 cents to 86 cents a share on sales of $1.32 billion to $1.47 billion, which suggests a decline from adjusted earnings of $1.04 a share on sales of $1.47 billion in the previous fiscal first quarter. Analysts on average were projecting adjusted earnings of $1.05 a share on sales of $1.49 billion, according to FactSet. NetApp did increase its dividend 20% for the first quarter. NetApp shares closed 4.1% lower at $67.10 Wednesday, then declined lower than $64 in after-hours action immediately following the release of the report.

        "Can NetApp Stock Move Higher? ": "Shares of cloud storage company NetApp (NTAP) have fallen close to 17.0% in the last 12 months. Since the start of May, NetApp stock has lost over 19.0%, and it’s currently trading 33.0% below its 52-week high of $88.08. Despite the recent pullback, NetApp shares have gained ~33.0% annually in the last three years.Last month, NetApp announced its fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter results (for the year that ended in April), which disappointed investors. NetApp’s revenue rose 4.0% YoY (year-over-year) to $1.59 billion in fiscal 2019, and it saw adjusted EPS of $1.22. Wall Street expected the company to post sales of $1.64 billion and EPS of $1.26.In the upcoming quarter, NetApp expects sales of between $1.32 billion and $1.47 billion and EPS of between $0.78 and $0.86—again below Wall Street’s revenue and earnings estimates of $1.5 billion and $1.05, respectively.NetApp has attributed its tepid quarterly performance and guidance to execution issues in sales as well as currency fluctuations. Contract renewals in the last quarter were lower than company expectations. NetApp also stated that data center deals are now taking longer than expected.NTAP is trading at a forward PE multiple of 11.8x. While analysts expect its earnings to rise 10.1% in fiscal 2020, they expect its earnings to rise at a compound annual growth rate of 17.9% over the next five years.Comparatively, its earnings have risen 11.7% in the last five years. Despite revenue growth in the low single digits, NetApp has been able to expand its bottom line robustly. It also has a dividend yield of 3.2%, and it seems undervalued considering its PE multiple.Of the 29 analysts tracking NetApp, 14 have given it “buy” ratings, 13 have given it “holds,” and two have given it “sells.” Analysts have a 12-month average target price of $79.3 on its stock, which indicates a potential upside of 35.0% from its current price.\nCopyright © 2020 Market Realist.

The results beat market expectations, but they followed a warning from NetApp earlier in the month that its performance would not meet earlier estimates. For Q1, the company reported non-GAAP net income per share of 65 cents, compared to $1.04 a year prior. Revenue came to $1.24 billion, compared to $1.47 billion a year prior. Last year's Q1 revenue included $90 million from enterprise software license agreements which did not repeat in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Wall Street was looking for earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $1.23 billion. Shares were up in after-hours trading. Two weeks ago, the storage vendor said it was lowering its first-quarter revenue guidance to between $1.22 billion and $1.24 billion.  The previous Q1 guidance from NetApp called for revenue of $1.31 billion to $1.46 billion. The company also lowered its EPS guidance, from a range of 78 cents a share to 86 cents, to a range of 55 cents a share to 60 cents.\"I am clearly disappointed with our Q1 top-line results but remain confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model,\" CEO George Kurian said in a statement Wednesday. \"The gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made provide support for our free cash flow generation and enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds while making the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth.\"He added that NetApp consistently receives positive feedback from customers and partners on the value of its Data Fabric strategy.NetApp reported Cloud Data Services annualized recurring revenue of approximately $61 million for the first quarter, an increase of 189 percent year-over-year. The company also returned $365 million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.For the second quarter, NetApp expects revenue in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion. \n                                   By\n               \nStephanie Condon\n\n            \n                    \n        \n                                        |            August 14, 2019 -- 20:37 GMT (13:37 PDT)\n        \n                                                                                    | Topic: Storage\nE-CommerceAmazon could spend $300M on developing COVID-19 testing this quarterCloudJeff Bezos tells Amazon shareowners: \"Take a seat\" as COVID-19 eats into profitsArtificial IntelligenceSalesforce's AI Economist aims to help leaders design tax policiesSocial EnterpriseFacebook reports mixed Q1 after taking ad revenue hit in MarchPlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.By registering, you agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices outlined in the Privacy Policy.You will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update Today and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.

        "NetApp Shares Plunge After Lower Q1'20 Revenue, Earnings Outlook": "NetApp says it expects a 17-percent drop in revenue compared to previously announced expectations, with GAAP income also falling by over 50 percent. NetApp shares on Thursday took a solid hit after the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company said it expects revenue and earnings to fall below expectations. The hybrid cloud data services and data management company's share price plummeted nearly 18 percent to the $48-range in after-hours trading.\n\nNetApp said it now expects its first fiscal quarter 2020 revenue of between $1.220 and $1.230 billion, which represents a decline of approximately 17 percent from the first quarter of fiscal year 2019. NetApp had previously guided net revenue of $1.315 to $1.465 billion. After accounting for $90 million in enterprise software license agreements from the first fiscal quarter of 2019 that did not repeat in the first quarter of 2020, revenue would have fallen 12 percent. \n[Related: NetApp CEO Kurian On HCI, Cloud, And Growth Prospects] \nNet income on a GAAP basis is now expected to be in the range of 30 cents to 35 cents per share, compared to the 56 cents to 64 cents per share the company previously expected. On a non-GAAP basis, net income is expected to be in the range of 55 cents to 60 cents per share, compared to the expected 78 cents to 86 cents per share.  For full fiscal year 2020, NetApp now expects revenue to be 5 percent to 10 percent below previous expectations. The company is slated to unveil its actual first fiscal quarter 2020 results on August 14. While NetApp is disappointed its preliminary first fiscal quarter results are lower than had previously anticipated, the company remains confident in its long-term strategy, said George Kurian, NetApp CEO, in a statement. \"Our customer conversations indicate that our hybrid multicloud portfolio of solutions is the right one. We believe we can return to growth over time by prudently reallocating investments to expand sales coverage and accelerate our participation in the growing private cloud and cloud data services markets,\" Kurian said in the statement.

Management blamed a broad slowdown in technology hardware spending due to global uncertainty.On Thursday evening, NetApp management pre-announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal 2020, which ends in July. It now expects earnings per share of 55 cents to 60 cents on $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion in revenue (a 17% decline from last year)—versus 78 cents to 86 cents in earnings per share on $1.32 billion to $1.47 billion in sales previously. Analysts’ prior consensus estimate was for earnings of 83 cents per share and revenue of $1.39 billion. For the full fiscal 2020, NetApp now expects revenue to be down between 5% and 10% from fiscal 2019’s $6.1 billion. When it first issued fiscal 2020 guidance in May, management had expected sales to grow 3% or 4% year over year. Its stock had dropped 22% to $45.10 at 11:56 a.m.“Our largest global enterprise accounts have taken a decidedly more cautious view of the macroeconomic environment,” NetApp CEO George Kurian said on an analyst call on Thursday evening. “These large accounts are spending considerably less in total CapEx this year compared to calendar year ‘18. In the past several years, we’ve had a focus on growing in our top global customers. We’ve made great progress in some, but need to do more to expand our share in a broader set of these customers. Because of our reliance on some of these very large accounts, we may be more susceptible to the slowdown in spending related to the macro.”NetApp’s two largest customers in its fiscal 2019 were\n            Arrow Electronics\n      (ARW) and\n            Tech Data\n      (TECD), which made up 24% and 20% of sales, respectively. Its ominous outlook dragged down other enterprise IT companies’ stocks on Friday as well:\n            Cisco Systems\n      (CSCO) fell 4.1%,\n            Dell Technologies \n      (DELL) slid 8.3%,\n            Hewlett Packard Enterprise\n      (HPE) slipped 5.7%,\n            Nutanix\n      (NTNX) dropped 6.8%, and\n            Pure Storage\n      (PSTG) tumbled 7.9%, versus a 1.2% fall for the S&P 500.Several Wall Street analysts lowered their estimates for NetApp’s earnings following the guidance cut. Their average price target fell to $61.60 on Friday, about 34% above the stock’s recent $46. Half of the 28 analysts who cover NetApp have a Hold or equivalent rating on the shares, while four call a them Sell and 10 recommend a Buy.

        "\n      NetApp stock plunges 13% after warning that earnings, revenue will come in well below forecast ": "NetApp Inc.\n        NTAP, \n        -2.47%\n      said Thursday afternoon that its fiscal year got off to a worse start than expected, and shares plunged more than 13% in late trading. The data-storage company said that it expects to report earnings of 30 cents to 35 cents a share on sales of $1.22 billion to $1.23 billion for its fiscal first quarter, with adjusted earnings of 55 cents to 60 cents a share. That is lower than NetApp's forecast, which called for earnings of 56 cents to 64 cents a share on sales of $1.32 billion to $1.47 billion, with adjusted earnings of 78 cents to 86 cents a share. Analysts on average were projecting adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share on sales of $1.39 billion, according to FactSet. NetApp also revised its full-year guidance, from expectations for single-digit sales growth to a revenue decline of 5% to 10%, and said investors should not rely on any of the company's forecasts delivered in May. NetApp did not explain the reason for missing its forecast, but planned a conference for 2 p.m. Pacific time. \"While we are disappointed that our preliminary results for the first quarter are lower than we had previously anticipated, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and the health of our business model,\" Chief Executive George Kurian said in the announcement. NetApp shares were halted just after the close of the regular trading session, and fell more than 13% in after-hours trading after they began to trade again about 20 minutes later. NetApp plans to fully report quarterly earnings on Aug. 14. Shares have declined 26.5% in the past year, as the S&P; 500 index has gained 5.9%.Apple Inc. reported Thursday that profits slipped slightly but sales grew amid the spread of COVID-19, and promised investors billions more in stock repurchases and dividends.Jeremy Owens is MarketWatch’s technology editor and San Francisco bureau chief.

My name is Lateef [Phonetic], and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2020 earnings call.

This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution gain share and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts and new buyers, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, improve the consistency of our sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy.Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically, our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K.During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated, reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.I'll now turn the call over to George.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining us. As we discussed on our call on August 1st, while I am clearly disappointed in our weaker-than-expected top line results, the fundamentals of our business are robust and I am confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the market transitions to all-flash arrays, private cloud and cloud data services. We have a strong business model as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. This enables us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth.We have further analyzed the dynamics of what happened in the first quarter and they confirm that we are seeing a combination of slowdown related to overall macro conditions and company-specific go-to market execution issues. We continue to see pressure on deal sizes, longer sales cycles and deferral of transactions. But as I noted on our earlier call, our underperformance is not across the board. Our APAC, Europe and US public sector geographies were mostly on track. Even in the areas where we experienced the greatest weakness, top global accounts and the Americas, there were pockets of strength and high performing teams.We have been very successful with some of our global accounts, but we need to expand our wallet share in others. We have deep relationships with too few of these customers, which increases our susceptibility to a slowdown in spending related to the macro. In the Americas, roughly 40% of our districts were successful in acquiring new customers, reaching new buyers within existing customers and effectively selling our entire portfolio, and as a result, grew year-over-year. Performance across districts is inconsistent. Our sales leadership and I are committed to improving our sales execution through necessary leadership changes, better inspection and discipline, expanded account coverage, acquisition and portfolio selling.Let me underscore the fact, that we do not believe that the revenue shortfall was related to a change in the competitive environment. Our win rates remain constant and our product gross margins remain strong. In short, we need to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. To better capitalize on our opportunity, we will expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses by continuing to make disciplined trade-offs in our spending priorities.To that end, I'll now provide more detail on the specific steps we are taking. First, we plan to add approximately 200 primary sales resources in the next 12 months with a focus in the Americas. We will do this without increasing the total operating expenses for the Company. The new sales headcount will focus on acquiring new accounts as well as engaging new buyers and finding new opportunities in existing accounts. Second, we will sharpen the focus of our all-flash go-to market, including marketing, sales and services, to emphasize our strong value proposition in mission critical environments, where customers continue to prioritize spending. We expect that this combined with additional sales capacity, will return us to a position of growth in the all-flash market.Third, now that our services are generally available in Azure and will soon be in Google, we expect to see an acceleration of cloud data services revenue, as their sales teams ramp in selling our service. We continue to focus on expanding the range of use cases and deployment scenarios and enabling the various pathways to market, to sell these services.And finally, we will scale our growth in the private cloud market, through focused marketing and sales efforts. The increased sales capacity focused on reaching non-storage buyers will support this effort. We are materially stepping up our efforts to address the appropriate buyers for our private cloud and cloud data services offerings, as they are different from our traditional storage buyers.To recap, I'm confident that we can return to growth by increasing our sales capacity, adding new accounts, reaching new non-storage buyers and selling the full portfolio. We expect that these efforts will accelerate our participation in the growing private cloud and cloud data services market. and drive share gains. Additionally, these actions will broaden our pipeline while lowering risks stemming from customer concentration.In Q1, our All-Flash Array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, declined 24% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion. This comparison includes a significant amount of yearly revenue related to all-flash in Q1 a year ago. That did not repeat in Q1 this year. While I'm disappointed by the performance of this part of the business, I remain confident in our competitive positioning and our opportunity for continued success. We have industry-leading, guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete cloud integration in the market today. And the actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and target mission critical workloads will help return our all-flash business to growth.Moving to our private cloud solutions, SolidFire, NetApp HCI and Storage Grid are the building blocks for private cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services, attained an annualized net revenue run rate of $250 million in the first quarter, up 85% year-over-year.Now onto cloud data services. In Q1 we achieved general availability with Microsoft with Azure NetApp Files and beta release with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. Based on the last month of Q1, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $61 million, up 189% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers, new to NetApp, in our cloud services, and expect that cloud services will continue to enable us to reach new buyers and contribute to our acquisition of new customers.We are very pleased with the initial ramp of Azure NetApp Files since becoming generally available. I'll share a customer example to illustrate why we are so excited. We are working with the Fortune 10 company to meet its Cloud-First initiative while delivering an equal or better experience to their on-premises environment with all the agility benefits of the cloud. The customer began testing Azure NetApp Files while it was in preview, and now that it's generally available, they have established a footprint of almost 2 petabytes and are growing by 100 terabytes per week. While some of this data will migrate from existing NetApp systems, roughly two-thirds of the data, they will move to Azure NetApp Files, currently resides on competitive storage system.Our sales team partnered closely with the Azure team to leverage our expertise to help the customer establish a data strategy in the cloud. By working directly with the customer's cloud leadership, we have moved from being merely an infrastructure provider with a minority position in the customer's data center to a key strategic partner. This is a great example of not only how our cloud strategy helps us expand our opportunity by displacing competitive footprint, but how also reaching new buyers. In this case, the cloud team contributes to our growth. As I have described many times, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our Data Fabric strategy and our unique relationships with the hyperscale cloud providers.Before closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank some longtime NetAppers who are moving on for their contributions to our Company. Tom Mendoza, Vice Chairman; Joel Reich, EVP, Storage Systems and Software business unit, and Thomas Stanley, Senior VP of the Americas. We wish them all well. As we align to execute and thrive in a highly dynamic environment, change is inevitable. To that end, I'd like to recognize two key promotions, Brad Anderson to EVP and GM overseeing both our cloud infrastructure and storage systems and software business units, and Scott Allen to Chief Accounting Officer. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Rohatchi [Phonetic], Senior VP and GM of Asia Pacific. I look forward to their contributions in the continuing evolution of NetApp.I am confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks, and the recently increased quarterly dividend. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of our business.We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers and partners on the value of our Data Fabric strategy and the strong performance of our best teams demonstrates our ability to capitalize on the strength. We are confident that we can return to growth by replicating their success in reaching more customers and buying centers with our full portfolio. We will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls. I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. To reiterate George's sentiment, we are clearly disappointed with the Q1 results and are committed to addressing the challenges we faced during the quarter. Despite the magnitude of our Q1 revenue shortfall, the gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made over the last three years provide support for our free cash flow generation. As a result, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and our recently increased quarterly dividend.Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 performance. In Q1, net revenues of $1.236 billion were down 16% year-over-year including over 1 point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $644 million decreased approximately 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Q1 '19 compare includes $90 million of ELA revenues which did not repeat this quarter. Adjusting for ELAs, Q1 revenue would have been down approximately 11% and product revenues would have been down approximately 18%.Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $523 million decreased 1% year-over-year, and was flat when adjusting for currency. Deferred revenue, which was up 8% year-over-year in Q1, continues to be a strong indicator of the health of our installed base. As we mentioned on the Q4 call, and to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business, we have updated our strategic and mature product view. Strategic product revenue includes add-on software, private cloud solutions and all products related to all-flash arrays. Mature product revenue now includes OEM and all products related to disk and hybrid arrays. A historical recast of the strategic mature breakout can be found on our website. As a reminder, cloud data services revenue is included in software maintenance.Gross margin of 67.2% was above the high end of our guidance range and includes approximately a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 53.4% which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year when adjusting for ELAs. The increase was driven by sales force discipline and cost reduction and includes nearly a point of currency headwinds. Q1 was the 10th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs.The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 82.1% increased by 50 basis points year-over-year.Q1 operating expenses of $652 million were flat year-over-year. Operating margin was 14.4%. EPS of $0.65 was above the preliminary estimate we provided on our August 1st call, but below our original guidance range.We closed Q1 with $3.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 10 days, up 10 days year-over-year. DSO of 40 days was up 2 days year-over-year and down 30 days sequentially. The underperformance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 25 days, an 8-day increase year-over-year. We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020.Despite the revenue shortfall in the quarter, cash flow from operations was $310 million. Free cash flow of $278 million represented 22% of revenues and was up approximately 6% year-over-year.During Q1, we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $64.87 for a total of $250 million, which is consistent with our planned run rate heading into fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $243 million, down $26 million year-over-year, representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $115 [Phonetic] million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $365 million to shareholders representing 131% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend is $0.48 per share.Now onto guidance. As we discussed on our August 1st call, we expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down between 5% and 10% year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential growth within the year to be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. For fiscal 2020, we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%, above our previous guidance range of 64% to 65%, due primarily to the mix shift toward higher margin maintenance revenues, as a result of the weakness in product sales.Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 19% to 22%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be flat to slightly down year-over-year in fiscal 2020. As George highlighted, we expect to add 200 headcount to our sales coverage model over the next 12 months. As a result of the current revenue guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 2% and 15% year-over-year without the benefit of buybacks.Given the relative weakness of our Americas business in Q1 , we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% in fiscal 2020. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues.Now onto Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies an 8% decline in revenues year-over-year, including over a point of currency headwind. For Q2, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 66% and operating margin to be between 18% and 19%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.91 and $0.99 per share.We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the Company to growth, as we implement the action plan George outlined. And we remain confident our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder returns.With that, I'll turn it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsWe'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator?Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Roja Hachey. Your line is open.Nehal Choksi -- Maxim Group -- AnalystThank you. You probably covered this in the script, but your guidance does call for a significant improvement of the year-over-year revenue growth profile. And I appreciate all the detail on what you're doing to address the shortfall. Is it true to say that these things that you're doing, you expect to actually result in that improvement this quickly?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentIf you look at our Q2 seasonality, there are sort of two or three elements that come into play. The first is, Q2 is typically a strong quarter for our US public sector business. The second is, cloud data services and our private cloud business should continue to perform in a normal seasonal acceleration model. And then the third is that, we have factored in and probably -- probability weighted a little impact from ELAs in Q2. As you might note from the call script, we did not see any ELAs in Q1.Nehal Choksi -- Maxim Group -- AnalystUnderstood. Okay. And then the deferred revenue continues to trend up year-over-year, despite the significant year-over-year product revenue decline, below even the July 2015 and July 2016 levels, is it safe to say that this is a reflection of an increasing attach of software and services per dollar of installed base?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo it's a function of several things. That's one. It's also a function of, we're doing a little better job on renewals and point of sale that -- point of sale rate for services held steady. So it's a focus area has been for a while, we told you that and we're doing a little better in it.Nehal Choksi -- Maxim Group -- AnalystGreat , thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Nehal. Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystYeah, thanks for the question, guys. I wanted to start off, I guess with the AFA weakness you called out George and see is. And it looks like, I mean, if we back that out the hybrid trajectory with OK. I mean things seem more stable there. So I wonder if you could just drill into that in a little bit more detail. What you see going on there is the factor of this macro weakness or are you seeing people backing off of AFA investment but keeping up with hybrid. And then I wanted to just double check, it is a housekeeping measure the -- you are guiding with ELAs in the guide this quarter. I just want to check that, because I thought previously you guys had decided not to guide ELAs anymore. So thanks.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerRon. So it's it's factored in with a probability. So there are some in there and we factored it down a little bit, just in case. So, and there was some in there last year, so that's a fair compare. But we didn't put it in at the full value.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to the mix of AFAs and hybrid, if you recall last year, we had two elements that drove the AFA business. The first was, we had several large global customers that purchased a lot of AFAs, and as we noted on our call, those customers are most impacted by the spending slowdown in the hardware. The second was that, we also had about $90 million of ELAs last year and a good chunk of that was attributed to all-flash purchases. So those two one-time items on the compare was what drove the AFA number down substantially more than HFA. I would not say that there was any pattern of customers not choosing AFAs as opposed to HFAs in the broad demand environment.Rod Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay, great. Thank you, George.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Rod. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.Matt Cabral -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you. Just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving the uptick in gross margin guidance for the year, and in particular, just how we should think about the trajectory of product margins? Again, it's just the potential for a pickup in the competitive environment, if some of this lower deal environment lingers a little bit?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerAnd so there is a couple of factors, I think biggest one is obviously, you can see that in the quarter as well. The product revenue was down year-over-year. So as a result, the services margin which is higher than product, weighs higher on the overall margin and pushes overall margin up. Having said that, we've told you for the last several years, we are working on improving gross margins. We've had 10 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement on the product margin side and that should continue throughout the year a little bit, both from a pricing standpoint and then some costs as well.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI want to call out the good work done by our sales teams on maintaining discipline. I know that, there are some people who think that there is a trade-off between revenue and margin. I think our teams have remained disciplined around the pricing environment. The strong gross margin indicates our competitive differentiation. And we have not walked away from revenue due to concerns of our gross margin. We have strategically used gross margin and our business model as an opportunity where we felt like it warranted it.Matt Cabral -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystThank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Matt. Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.Mehdi Hosseini -- SIG. -- AnalystYes, thanks for taking my question. George, going back to your comment on AFA, it seems to me that -- even if I were to exclude the ELA from FY '19, the overall AFA revenue could be down in the high-teen FY '20 versus FY '19. Is it a fair assumption?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentIt is down a good amount. I think it is primarily due to our exposure from being very broadly deployed in big global strategic accounts that did not have as robust a spending pattern this year. The AFA business is the dominant business that we have in the big global customers, and they were the most impacted by some of the uncertainty that we saw with regard to macro.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you, Mehdi. Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.Andrew Nowinski -- Piper Jaffray -- AnalystGreat, thank you. I just had a question on your OEM business. Last quarter, you talked about moving away from some OEM partners and focusing more -- on more strategic partners such as Lenovo. I think the OEM revenues included in the mature segments. So I was wondering, is that $307 million you did in mature this quarter, in line with what you're expecting? Or do you also see weakness at your OEM partners? Thanks.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah. We saw a little bit of weakness. And as you know it can be fairly lumpy. It's hard to predict oftentimes what OEM customers are going to buy. We feel comfortable with the outlook for the year for OEM, which as we told you last quarter is probably not as robust and we're accepting that, but again, we didn't see a robust quarter this quarter, we do expect to meet the year plan.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentOEM is a small percentage of the mature category and frankly the smallest percentage of the mature category. We are driving focus on Lenovo and it will take some time for that business to ramp. Once it ramps, it will stabilize the OEM revenue.Andrew Nowinski -- Piper Jaffray -- AnalystAll right, thanks.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Andy. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystYeah. Thank you. George, you talked about why your flash business in particular is down double-digits this quarter given the large enterprise exposure. What do you think the market for flash storage did in the quarter? Is the market also declining? And then can you talk about how long it will take for the 200 new hires to reach their full sales quota? And what will be the funding source of those hires given you don't expect to grow OpEx? Thanks.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI couldn't comment yet on the overall flash market Katy. I think that our view is that as NAND prices remain low, flash is compellingly better technology than disk for a broad range of transactional applications and so as a percentage of the mix, it should benefit from the fact that NAND prices are lower.In terms of the headcount that -- so we're going to have to wait to see what other people report and sort of an overall market wrap up to comment about flash. We think that in our case, the concentration of our largest customers, also being our largest flash customers, drove the sort of change in our flash business.With regard to the investment we're making in sales and primary demand creation headcount, they're not all discrete quota-bearing headcount. There are some technical sales headcount as well . We are going to do that over 12 months, I think you will see a ramp through that period, as we get operationally ready and deploy that sales headcount. And so you should quarterize 200 over four quarters and it typically takes us about three quarters to four quarters to get them fully productive after they are on board.Katy Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to what trade-offs we're going to make -- listen, we've done a good job making trade-offs over the last several years. You can see that in our operating margins and gross margins and we'll continue to make the appropriate choices to prioritize our investments into the biggest opportunities. We think we have a really good portfolio and we think that based on the results we're seeing with our best teams we can deploy more headcount and capture more of the market footprint. And so we're going to stay disciplined around that.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks Katy. Next question.OperatorOur next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystYes, thanks a lot guys. I guess, George, I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about how do you see the cloud services business ramping up through the fiscal year and you were fairly positive I think on how that Azure ramp has gone especially with GA, wondering how would you contrast the Google process as you go forward, and how do you think that will be comparable or different what was happening with (Indecipherable) given the fact Google I think bought something comparable in Elastifile recently.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentFirst of all, we are very pleased with the progress all of our cloud services business, it's up 189% year-on-year and I think the range of things that we see the differentiation of our technology, the ability to migrate big customer workloads in a really cost effective manner to the public cloud, and to be able to displace competitive footprint, they're all showing up.I think with regard to the plans of what we are executing to it is to quantify more workloads and to get deployed into more data centers, that gives us a broader footprint of opportunity to go after, to train the sales force, both the Microsoft sales force and the NetApp sales force. around selling these technologies in joint ways and that will take time. These are big teams and it takes us time to get all of them trained. So you should expect a ramp through the course of the year, getting stronger each quarter as more people are enabled.With regard to Google, we think that we have as good an opportunity to migrate customer workloads to the Google Cloud. Elastifile is not a competitive product to what we have, it's a commodity offering to compete with the low-end file storage service, it's not an enterprise-grade file storage service. And so we feel that our opportunity is undiminished. We are in beta and we are focused on the next step, which is to get to general availability. So far what we see is a similar pattern of customer trials, testing, and so on and so we've done operational readiness with one cloud provider. We're going to work on the second. And then as we get to GA, we'll give you more details about it.Amit Daryanani -- Evercore ISI -- AnalystPerfect, thanks for the insight.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks Amit. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystThanks, good afternoon and thanks for the color on the quarter. I'm just struggling a little bit with the assumption that some of the macro weakness is fairly compartmentalized around the large OEMs. Is there any other points or conversations you could point to rather rather that would say that you don't see further weakness in some smaller customers in Europe and the US going forward? I'm just curious, the confidence level in the macro at this point. Thanks.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think that our perspective on the macro is very similar to what is reflected in the public commentary on the markets. We saw weakness in certain parts of Europe where GDP growth is challenged, for example, in Germany, a little bit. And in the UK where the sort of ongoing dialog on Brexit is causing temporary pauses in spending, and then we saw it in the global customers who we do a lot of business with, right. I think we did not say that the enterprises that for the next year down weren't exposed to the macro, it's our exposure to a particular customer is a lot lower when they are smaller, and we have a diverse book of business in the smaller and mid-sized customers than the giant global customers. So I would tell you that what we experienced was a combination of macro and the big relationships that we have with some of these large global accounts.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystThat's helpful. Thank you very much.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Steve. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Market. Your line is open.Lou Miscioscia -- Daiwa Capital Market -- AnalystOkay, thank you. I guess, George, if you could give us a view as to how, I guess you viewed the sales operation since when you came in. I think that if we go back to 2015 when you first started, one of the options. I think your predecessor had talked about was materially increasing the sales force because you view that as that would fix some of the problems, and I guess the question I have, and a bit of the difficult to get -- have it, here we are X number of years later, I realize the macro is very weak. So can fully understand that, but you would think that the sales force would be at a run rate level now after all these years. But you wouldn't have to go out and either, A, increase it, and I'm not saying that that's wrong, but also, B, that there is a high level of ones that you've talked about in the last call that were not at their appropriate productive level. I think we would be at a pretty good steady state. So if you could just help us understand that and maybe also a milestone or number you're adding 200. I mean, how big is the sales force at least maybe that will help us understand that statistically maybe why there is a couple of issues here. Thank you.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think, first of all, with regard to the work that we've done in the field organization as we have said we have transformed many elements of the field organization particularly by implementing of coverage model that allows us to prioritize our resources against the biggest accounts, and the biggest opportunities. We started the implementation of coverage against the big global accounts in a more systematic way two years to three years ago, which is what drove the results that we had alongside the big global accounts, we don't cover a 100% of the largest 2,000 to 3,000 accounts in the world. And we believe given the results that we've had that we have the opportunity by expanding coverage to a broader set of accounts that we can grow our business.We have also implemented new selling motions right, like covering certain markets through the channel. You saw us restructuring parts of our European organization, so that we could afford the investments in covering the bigger accounts and the bigger countries, by moving some of our countries approximately 15 of them to be served through the channel. We have constructed a joint venture in China together with Lenovo, so that we could participate in the China market in a more efficient fashion. So we've done a lot of things to change the structure and the composition of the sales force.We think that by adding a combination of resources to go after the market, approximately 8% to 10% increase in coverage, we should be able to continue to grow our business in the top line, which is the fundamental issue we've had. If you look at the rest of the P&L, we've had an exceptionally strong result across gross margin and operating margin and all of the other elements of cash generation. And we think that this is specifically a top line issue, we think that by broadening our coverage and footprint, we should be able to mitigate the impact of the macro on a few large customers that today we are exposed to.Lou Miscioscia -- Daiwa Capital Market -- AnalystOkay, thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Lou. Next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open.Tim Long -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. I can just ask kind of a two-part here on visibility. Obviously would happens last quarter took you little bit by surprise. Can you just talk a little bit about this full year view and how you feel about the second half and did you do some factoring of kind of pipeline like you did for the ELAs in the quarter? And then just, Ron, if you could remind me the visibility into the installed base. I get it the deferred rose, but we did have a decline in the -- in a few of the revenue lines, the product services and hardware maintenance. So if you could just flesh out for us that installed base view, that'd be great. Thank you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerSo let me start with that one. So when you look at maintenance, you've got to kind of combined with software maintenance and hardware maintenance together, as we've changed the value associated with each over a period of time. Certainly, as it relates to the annuity installed base. When you add them together, they're down 1% year-over-year, when you adjust for FX, they're flat. The fact of matter is, we are growing our installed base of systems under contract and have been really for the last eight quarters. So it's actually very healthy, which you see reflected in deferred revenue numbers.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are not expecting a rapid resolution of either the macro or some of the uncertainty around trade. And so we factored in a fairly conservative profile and outlook in the overall picture. It is reflective of typical linearity based on a very slow start in Q1. And it includes some of the fact that our second half has an easier compare, compared to our first half of this year. And so we're not expecting some miraculous rebound in terms of the macro environment.I think with regard to ELAs, as we said, ELAs comprise about 2% of the total revenue in the year. We don't break it out on a per-quarter basis. You should factor in some sort of run rate for ELAs within our broader guidance.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerIt's just to add to that, Tim, remember, we have no ELAs in Q1, limited in Q2. So most of the ELAs will happen in the second half, actually -- the second half number.Tim Long -- Barclays -- AnalystOkay, thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Tim. Next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open.Jim Suva -- Citigroup -- AnalystThanks very much, Ron and George. A quick question for each of you. Ron, you just mentioned limited ELAs next quarter and then more in the second half, if I heard that correctly. And when you say more in the second half, do we think then about annual run rate that you've been talking or how should we think about the ELAs in the second half?And then, George, if you could just help us understand, adding 200 salespeople within America, that's very good, and a couple of quarters to ramp. But I think I heard you say no additional expenses. So how does that work out, is that just a reallocation or how do you work out more people with no additional costs?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah, so just on the ELAs, I won't give you the number in Q2, but it's not huge, obviously I factored it down, which means that mostly ELAs will be in the second half, again, to George's point, we told you that ELAs are roughly 2% of total revenue. So you should expect the majority of that in the second half of the year.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to the sales capacity, as I said, they are not our primary quota-bearing headcount. The majority of the 200 should be quota-bearing headcount, but it's a combination of front-line quota-bearing headcount, technical resources and management. We are going to deploy them in a graded fashion over four quarters and you should expect a ramp through those quarters, as we get the operational momentum of hiring and all of that in place. It takes three quarters to four quarters, as we've said consistently for a sales rep to get productive, right? And some of these are going to be focused on selling our private cloud and public cloud portfolios, which have a different business model or profile than a traditional storage system.With regard to how do we expect to hire 200 people and not impact operating expenses, I'll just say we have north of 10,500 people on the Company's payroll and so we will make the appropriate trade-offs across our broader employee population, as we think about people who leave the Company and the shape of people we hire will shape it toward the sales organization, so that we can accelerate the turnaround.Jim Suva -- Citigroup -- AnalystGreat, thank you so much for the details and clarifications, that's greatly appreciated.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThank you, Jim.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Jim. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystYeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to Amit's question earlier on the cloud data services business. First of all, just to kind of clarification, relative to what you said on the pre-announcement now today, are you endorsing the fact that you still believe you will be at that $400-plus million run rate exiting fiscal '21? And then kind of building on that, your one of the comments in the prepared remarks is that CDS is ramping and there are some elements of cannibalization to the traditional business. I'm trying to understand of how you think about that? Should we consider that as CDS ramps, there is going to be some cannibalization of the traditional on-premise business for you guys? Just any kind of clarification or help on that would be useful.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentFirst of all, I think we are pleased with the momentum that we have in the CDS business. We still have the plan to be in the $400 million to $600 million annual recurring run rate exiting Q4 of fiscal '21 and we're executing to that plan. There is a lot of work that goes into that, but having a leading hyperscaler like Microsoft, now, generally available is a good benchmark. And the next benchmark is to scale them and to get Google Cloud platform to general availability. So we're heads down and executing our game plan.I think with regard to the pace of customer adoption, we feel very good about the early results, right? And I think that you should see that ramp through the course of the year. With regard to cannibalization, I would just tell you that, the fact that NetApp technology is available in the Microsoft Cloud or the Google Cloud, doesn't necessarily mean that the customer is going to move the NetApp workloads first to the cloud. They have a pattern of workloads they want to move to the cloud, we get to participate in a much broader opportunity, as a result of having our technology now being the enterprise platform for both Microsoft and Google, at the expense of our competition, right, that loses every dollar that moves to the cloud, they're going to get zero, we get to participate in two of the biggest hyperscalers now capturing those workloads onto our platform.Does it on the margin cause some cannibalization? That's already factored into the on-premise business versus the public cloud business forecasts that people have. We just now get to participate in a much more meaningful way in the public cloud business than anybody else. And in some ways, that is also helping us now with new footprint on-premises, as customers now say, listen, I discovered NetApp in the public cloud. I want to give them a bigger footprint on-prem.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo -- AnalystVery helpful, thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Aaron. Next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital, your line is open.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital -- AnalystGood afternoon. Appreciate taking the questions. Yeah, just going back to AFA. I guess, just a two-part for both George and Ron if I could. We'd love to get a sense of, if you're seeing incremental pricing pressure over the last couple of quarters in AFA even if it's from the customers as the deal sizes have shrunk a bit. And then, just sticking with AFA, I'd love to get a sense of, if you think that macro aside just industry penetration, the velocity of industry penetration has been slowing at all. And your thoughts around that. Thanks a lot.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYou know, I'll tell you what we saw with our AFA business is that customers bought more of the mid-range configurations and bought the capacity that they needed for the next year or rather than rightsizing the equipment for a three-year outlook, right? And that is, you know what I would do if I were faced with an uncertain budget environment, so we did see that fairly systematically. I think with regard to AFA versus the overall storage market, I think that the the economics of AFAs compared to hybrid continues to grow and get better, right? If you look at NAND prices, they continue to make AFA a much more attractive value proposition than they were in the past, every quarter. And so, if I were a customer, I would continue to prioritize AFA for all by transactional applications. The overall landscape for storage is dependent on the macro. And so I don't see the mix changing. I just look at the overall water level being determined by the macro.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital -- AnalystOkay, got it. That's helpful. I appreciate the context. Thanks.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Ananda. Next question.OperatorThe next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street. -- AnalystYeah, I just wanted to clarify, a couple of weeks ago, you talked about the shortfall being about two-thirds macro, one-third NetApp-specific, wanted to make sure that was -- you still felt that was the case after a couple of weeks of analysis? And then second part of the question has to do with, you've turned over your EVP, Americas, wondering if there is any any turnover below that senior level, because obviously that would make the adding to the sales more of a back-end loaded 2020 effort. I would think that that might slow things down on the sales hiring.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, I think that our analysis leads us to draw the same conclusion, which is, it's two-third macro, one-third, yes, we could have executed better. We did see some exposure from our being concentrated in some of the larger accounts, right? And I think that that's consistent with -- I want to just say that our leadership team -- we wish all of the members of our leadership team well. We have the need to continue to add capacity. That's the fundamental area of focus for us. We'll continue to make -- inspect our business and we'll provide you updates on our execution improvements over time. I'll just leave it there.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street. -- AnalystBut whether second level turnover, obviously there was at the EVP level, but kind of one level down from that?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentNo.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street. -- AnalystOkay, thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Eric. Next question.OperatorNext question comes for Andrew Vadheim of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.Andrew Vadheim -- Wolfe Research -- AnalystThank you. I wanted to follow up on the full-year outlook. And what role macro plays. So if you look at 1Q regarding the geographic breakdown of your revs, especially focusing on the EMEA, and APAC, 1Q numbers were pretty close to our expectations. And if you look at the geographic split back to your full year guide, are you embedding sort of a flat or slightly down EMEA, and APAC for the year and then uncertainty in Americas gets you to down 10 at the low end to down 5 at the high-end or does the bottom slashed top of the range embed a bull bear case for EMEA and APAC?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerI'd rather not go into some of the specific assumptions we made by geo. I think we did look at several things, we looked at what we're seeing in the macro environment, each of those geographies, we talked to the local sales leadership et cetera. We're making judgments overall. So I can't tell you the exact trade-offs we made, but we are looking at, of the downside is down 10% for the year. So obviously, you'll see that probably most profoundly down in the Americas, kind of given where we are. But beyond that, I'm not going to give any other detail.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI'll just say I think all of the calculations and factors we considered are in the public domain, right? And we use those factors to determine broad-based economic trajectories and then combine that with the judgment and the pipeline data of our sales teams and the historical linearity pattern of our business.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right, thank you, Andrew. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Nick Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is open.Nick Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystHi, thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about customer concentration a couple of times today. Can you give us a little bit more color maybe an example of how much revenue your top or top 10 or 15 customers account for?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWe are not going to break that out. I would just say that the impact of what happened during the quarter was primarily due to the fact that some of our largest global accounts that we have very strategic relationships with did not spend anywhere close to what they spent last year. I'll give you an example, we had two large customers that are exposed to the China tariff situation that have cut their capital spending by north of 30% year-on-year. Clearly , we are a part of that spending profile and so I would just say that we have really good relationships with the big set of customers and we are planning to broaden those relationships to another broader set of customers over the course of the next year to 18 months.Nick Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystOkay. And can I squeeze one more in, can you remind us how much you have remaining on your buyback authorization? And that'll be fine.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerWe have $1.6 billion left on the authorization.Nick Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystOkay, thanks guys, good luck.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Nick. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James. -- AnalystThank you. During the prepared remarks, you did indicate that you're not seeing any change in the competitive environment. I just wanted to maybe get a better understanding of whether or not we might see the market share shifts as measured by the third party that might reflect differences in geographies or differences in terms of footprint where maybe a competitor might be upgrading its legacy footprint and you've completed that task. Just trying to get a little bit, a better understanding of how you can be confident that it's not about competition and how to square this with third-party research? Thank you.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think that you know what we mean when we say it's not a competitive factor is that our win rates in competitive transactions remains the same. Our product gross margins were up 280 basis points year-on-year when you adjust for ELAs which shows the strength of our differentiation, right? I think there may be differences in how the results play out for different providers depending on their customer basis. We did see exposure from our biggest customers not buying as much, right? And I think that what we are convinced off is that if we expand our footprint and broaden our customer coverage, given the strength of the performance we've had in the places where we saw budget available and our ability to win competitive transactions, we should be able to broaden our book of business and reduce the effects of customer concentration.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James. -- AnalystThank you for the clarification.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you, Simon. Next question.OperatorNext question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.Mehdi Hosseini -- SIG. -- AnalystYes, I have two follow-ups, Ron, if I were just to look at your guide for the October quarter operating margin, it seems to me that OpEx would actually go up by $10 to $15 million, is that a fair assumption?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean, it goes up as a function of revenue share.Mehdi Hosseini -- SIG. -- AnalystSure. Okay. So just going back to the comment of adding additional sales people, this OpEx is just nature of the revenue. Nothing to do with --Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerYes. You won't see a huge impact to OpEx in the quarter for the hiring, it takes a while to get people on board. You'll see some increase is baked in there, but most of that's just a function of the linearity throughout the year, linear revenues and the headcount structure. So --Mehdi Hosseini -- SIG. -- AnalystAnd I just have a quick follow-up to the AFA question asked earlier. Your comments suggested there is a high-teen decline in AFA revenue FY '20 versus FY '19. But as I look at the back half of this Slide 20, I see a nice rebound driven by the migration of the 10 K-RPM to SSD, and that should build momentum into calendar year into the fiscal year '21. Is that a fair assumption as to what could drive a rebound in AFA?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think first of all, what we said was -- it was reflective of Q1 results. Q1 FY '20 over Q1 FY '19 being down in the high teens, right? I think with regard to the rest of the year, I'm not going to break out AFA versus HFA. I think that AFA is advantaged on a whole bunch of dimensions and should continue to get a bigger share of the pie of storage, relative to HFA than it was in prior years, just because of NAND economics, QLC, all kinds of things. I think we will continue to use every opportunity we can to drive transitions of disk-based systems and hybrid-based systems to our flash systems. The pace of those upgrades is a combination of, yes, good technology being available, but also budget cycles being available. And so we're going to lean in on the technology side and give customers every opportunity to upgrade. But we'll have to wait to see how the macro plays out, to see how many of those budget cycles are available.Mehdi Hosseini -- SIG. -- AnalystGot it. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you. Mehdi. I'll now pass it back to George for a couple of closing comments.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks, Kris. I'm disappointed in our weaker-than-expected top line results, but I remain confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the key market transitions. We have a strong business model, as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of the business, and we remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and quarterly dividend.The robust fundamentals of our business enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us to return to growth. I hope to see you at the investors session of our Annual Insight User Conference on October the 29th in Las Vegas.

        "\n      \n    Why NetApp Stock Fell 17.8% Last Month ": "Returns as of 5/1/2020Returns as of 5/1/2020Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services.Shares of NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) shed 17.8% of their value in August, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The stock tumbled after the enterprise data services company cut its first-quarter sales and profit outlook and lowered its full-year sales growth guidance. Management cited macroeconomic factors (including the trade standoff between the U.S. and China) as contributing to reduced customer demand.Data source: NTAP by YCharts.NetApp published preliminary first-quarter results on Aug. 1, and the company reported that sales for the period were likely to come in between $1.22 and $1.23 billion -- down significantly from initial guidance for revenue between $1.315 billion to $1.465 billion. Management also slashed the target on non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share to between $0.55 and $0.60 -- down from the previous guidance for earnings per share between $0.78 and $0.86.  Image source: Getty Images.While the company had stated in May that it expected sales for the year to grow at the low end of the mid-single-digit range, NetApp's preliminary first-quarter results arrived with news that annual revenue is poised to fall between 5% and 10%. By the time that NetApp actually reported its first-quarter results on Aug. 14, expectations had been lowered and the stock posted little movement. Revenue for the period came in at $1.24 billion, down 15.6% year over year. Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.65, significantly ahead of the average analyst estimate -- but also down 37.5% from adjusted earnings of $1.04 in the prior-year period.NetApp stock has regained some ground in September. The company's share price is up 13.4% in the month's trading so far, and appears to have benefited from executive vice president and chief financial officer Ron Pasek's presentation at the Citi Global Technology Conference on Sept. 5.Data source: NTAP by YCharts.NetApp management reports that the company is still seeing strong customer enthusiasm for the business's hybrid-cloud data services. Pasek outlined some of the macroeconomic headwinds the business is facing and highlighted growth opportunities for the company in on-premise flash storage, private cloud, and cloud data services.NetApp stock trades at roughly 13 times this year's expected earnings and has a dividend yield of 3%.Stock Advisor launched in February of 2002.

        "NetApp Stock Plunges on Preliminary Results ": "NetApp’s (NTAP) shares have fallen 21.3% in the last two trading days. The data storage company’s stock fell over 20.0% yesterday after the company announced preliminary results for its first quarter of fiscal 2020, with the company’s year ending in April. It also revised its full-year guidance on August 2, 2019.NetApp forecast revenue between $1.22 billion and $1.23 billion in the first quarter, a fall of 17.0% year-over-year. After adjusting for ELAs (enterprise software license agreements), the company’s revenue is forecast to decline by 12.0% year-over-year. The company has estimated adjusted EPS (earnings per share) between $0.55 and $0.60. Earlier, NetApp had forecast sales between $1.31 billion and $1.46 billion with EPS between $0.78 and $0.86 in the first quarter.For fiscal 2020, NetApp estimates sales to fall between 5.0% and 10.0% year-over-year. During NetApp’s last earnings call, it estimated sales to grow by single digits in 2020.Wall Street analysts estimate NetApp to post sales of $1.38 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 this October. This would be a decline of 6.3% year-over-year compared to sales of $1.47 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Analysts also expected earnings to fall by 21.1% to $0.82 in the first quarter. NetApp’s earnings are now expected to fall by a significant 44.2% in the first quarter.Analysts had forecast its sales to grow by 1.6% year-over-year to $6.24 billion in 2020. NetApp’s earnings were anticipated to rise by 7.7% as well. However, the company’s press release yesterday was far from encouraging, resulting in a massive share price decline.The company attributed the revised guidance to lower technology spending. NetApp’s CEO George Kurian stated, “While we are disappointed that our preliminary results for the first quarter are lower than we had previously anticipated, we remain confident in our long-term strategy and the health of our business model. Our customer conversations indicate that our hybrid multi-cloud portfolio of solutions is the right one. We believe we can return to growth over time by prudently reallocating investments to expand sales coverage and accelerate our participation in the growing Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services markets.”NetApp’s lower guidance impacted the stock price of peer companies as well. Shares of Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell Technologies Class V (DVMT), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), VMware (VMW), and Box (BOX) fell 4.0%, 9.2%, 6.2%, 8.3%, and 3.4% respectively.NetApp investors had an optimistic run from the start of 2016 to September 2018. The company’s shares returned a staggering 310.0% in that period. However, the stock has since fallen 48.0%. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the company’s results disappointed investors as the company faced execution issues coupled with currency fluctuations. However, this pullback provides an interesting opportunity for investors. NetApp shares are trading at a forward price to earnings multiple of 8.5 times.While the company is grappling with a revenue and earnings decline this fiscal, its fundamentals remain strong. NetApp will most likely return to revenue growth in 2021. The company has high operating leverage, which will mean earnings expansion will far outpace revenue growth. Further, NetApp also has a dividend yield of 4.2% and has increased its dividends in the last five consecutive years.This suggests that, while the stock is likely to experience short-term fluctuations, it is a bargain buy for investors at the current price. NetApp will release its first-quarter results on August 14.\nCopyright © 2020 Market Realist. All rights reserved."

        "NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) 3.4% Dividend Yield Looks Pretty Interesting – Simply Wall St News": " Dividend paying stocks like NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) tend to be popular with investors, and for good reason – some research suggests a significant amount of all stock market returns come from reinvested dividends. Unfortunately, it’s common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.  So you may wish to consider our analysis of NetApp’s financial health, here.  With a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if NetApp is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. It sure looks interesting on these metrics – but there’s always more to the story . The company also bought back stock during the year, equivalent to approximately 14% of the company’s market capitalisation at the time. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying NetApp for its dividend, and we’ll go through these below.  Explore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on NetApp!  Dividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable – hardly an ideal situation. So we need to form a view on if a company’s dividend is sustainable, relative to its net profit after tax. In the last year, NetApp paid out 42% of its profit as dividends. This is a medium payout level that leaves enough capital in the business to fund opportunities that might arise, while also rewarding shareholders. Besides, if reinvestment opportunities dry up, the company has room to increase the dividend.  Another important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. NetApp’s cash payout ratio in the last year was 35%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It’s positive to see that NetApp’s dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.  With a strong net cash balance, NetApp investors may not have much to worry about in the near term from a dividend perspective.  From the perspective of an income investor who wants to earn dividends for many years, there is not much point buying a stock if its dividend is regularly cut or is not reliable. Looking at the data, we can see that NetApp has been paying a dividend for the past six years. The dividend has been quite stable over the past six years, which is great to see – although we usually like to see the dividend maintained for a decade before giving it full marks, though. During the past six-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.60 in 2013, compared to US$1.92 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 21% per year over this time.  The dividend has been growing pretty quickly, which could be enough to get us interested even though the dividend history is relatively short. Further research may be warranted.  Dividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. It’s good to see NetApp has been growing its earnings per share at 16% a year over the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing at a good rate, and the company is paying less than half its earnings as dividends. We generally think this is an attractive combination, as it permits further reinvestment in the business.  When we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. It’s great to see that NetApp is paying out a low percentage of its earnings and cash flow. We were also glad to see it growing earnings, although its dividend history is not as long as we’d like. NetApp performs highly under this analysis, although it falls slightly short of our exacting standards. At the right valuation, it could be a solid dividend prospect.  Earnings growth generally bodes well for the future value of company dividend payments.

        "Is NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) P/E Ratio Really That Good? – Simply Wall St News": " Today, we’ll introduce the concept of the P/E ratio for those who are learning about investing. We’ll apply a basic P/E ratio analysis to NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP), to help you decide if the stock is worth further research. NetApp has a price to earnings ratio of 12.69, based on the last twelve months. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 7.9%.  View our latest analysis for NetApp  The formula for P/E is:  Price to Earnings Ratio = Share Price ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for NetApp:P/E of 12.69 = $50.55 ÷ $3.98 (Based on the year to July 2019.)  The higher the P/E ratio, the higher the price tag of a business, relative to its trailing earnings. That isn’t necessarily good or bad, but a high P/E implies relatively high expectations of what a company can achieve in the future.  The P/E ratio essentially measures market expectations of a company. If you look at the image below, you can see NetApp has a lower P/E than the average (20.4) in the tech industry classification.  This suggests that market participants think NetApp will underperform other companies in its industry.  Generally speaking the rate of earnings growth has a profound impact on a company’s P/E multiple. When earnings grow, the ‘E’ increases, over time. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. And as that P/E ratio drops, the company will look cheap, unless its share price increases.  NetApp’s earnings made like a rocket, taking off 298% last year. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 16% is also impressive. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio. The market might therefore be optimistic about the future, but that doesn’t guarantee future growth. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.  Don’t forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).  While growth expenditure doesn’t always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.  NetApp has net cash of US$2.0b. This is fairly high at 16% of its market capitalization. That might mean balance sheet strength is important to the business, but should also help push the P/E a bit higher than it would otherwise be.  NetApp trades on a P/E ratio of 12.7, which is below the US market average of 17.2. Not only should the net cash position reduce risk, but the recent growth has been impressive. The relatively low P/E ratio implies the market is pessimistic.  Investors have an opportunity when market expectations about a stock are wrong.

        "NetApp CEO Kurian Touts Cloud Innovation For Return To Growth": "NetApp is counting on its cloud innovations, including its Keystone technology for consuming storage any way customers want as well as its relationships with public cloud companies, to help it continue to recover from its poor first fiscal first quarter. NetApp and its investor community seem to have renewed confidence in the storage vendor a quarter after poor financial results caused many to express concerns about the company's future. While NetApp's second fiscal quarter 2020 revenue came in just short of analysts' expectations, its solid and growing all-flash storage array and cloud businesses packed more than enough punch to bring earnings well above expectations.NetApp's share price showed how well the company recovered from its first fiscal quarter 2020 when the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company pre-announced unexpectedly low revenue and income because of what the company termed as a poor macroeconomic environment. \n[Related: CRN Exclusive: NetApp CEO George Kurian On Keystone, Clouds And Competition] \nThose macroeconomic headwinds are still there, NetApp CEO George Kurian on Wednesday told financial analysts during the company's second fiscal quarter 2020 quarterly financial conference call. \"Despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential for continuing unpredictability in enterprise purchasing behavior, the fundamentals of our business are strong. … Both macroeconomic and enterprise spending indicators show continued weakness,\" he said. \"While we cannot predict when conditions will improve, we are planning our business assuming no change in these external factors for the foreseeable future.\" NetApp's future looks strong as it continues to focus on developing technology to build hybrid multi-cloud environments for customers, Kurian said. He cited last month's NetApp Insight conference in Las Vegas as a way to show how far the company has moved in that direction, particularly with the introduction of NetApp Keystone, the latest addition to its Data Fabric strategy that introduces the ability to treat all storage, whether on-premises or in multiple clouds, the same regardless of whether it is purchased or consumed as a service. Insight made it clear that NetApp's strategy, innovation, and experience is helping solve real pain points for customers looking to manage complex hybrid multi-cloud IT environments, Kurian said. Insight saw NetApp move to revolutionize customer experience and simplify the business of hybrid multi-cloud with NetApp Keystone, Kurian said. \"NetApp Keystone creates a consistent experience from public cloud to the data center helping customers transform IT to operate with cloud-like ease and flexibility everywhere,\" he said. NetApp Keystone does this in three ways, which customers can mix and match, Kurian said. The first is by allowing customers to consume NetApp technology as a consumption-based cloud service through the world's biggest public clouds for customers looking for true elastic scaling without needing to manage their own infrastructures, he said. The second is to consume NetApp technology via a subscription service to provide a cloud-like experience with their own on-premises infrastructure. The third is a new simplified ownership experience for businesses who prefer to own and operate the technology in their own data centers. \"Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our unique ability to offer a full range of capabilities needed to build their data fabric,\" he said. \"NetApp Keystone compliments this with a consistent cloud-like customer experience across the public cloud and on-premises. Let me be clear. Our approach to cloud is giving us access to new buyers and workloads as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. Cloud gives us both opportunity in the public cloud and makes us more attractive for on-premises deployments.\" Kurian said NetApp's cloud data services business in the quarter rose 167 percent year-over-year, and that the second fiscal quarter was the first full quarter for Azure NetApp Files, which brings an Azure-consistent to storage procurement, support, and billing. The company's Cloud Volume Services is also available in all three leading hyperscalers to give customers who have not in the past deployed NetApp on-premises storage the ability to take advantage of the company's technology via public clouds. \"Customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our Data Fabric strategy and our unique relationship with the hyperscale cloud providers,\" he said. \"Our cloud data services not only give us access to customers and workloads that were heretofore inaccessible with our traditional solutions. They improve our competitive position for on-premises opportunities. Only NetApp has the strategy, innovation portfolio, and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT.\" For its second fiscal quarter 2020, which ended October 25, NetApp reported total revenue of $1.37 billion, down just under 10 percent from the $1.52 billion the company reported for its second fiscal quarter 2019. That was $10 million lower than analysts' expectations, according to Seeking Alpha. That included product revenue of $771 million, down from last year's $913 million; software maintenance revenue of $254 million, up from $236 million, and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $346 million, down from last year's $368 million. On the product side, NetApp's strategic product revenue was $442 million, down from last year's $485 million. The company's mature product revenue also fell to $329 million from last year's $428 million. About 56 percent of total revenue came from its Americas business, down from 57 percent last year. About 79 percent of total revenue during the quarter came from NetApp's indirect channels, up from 77 percent last year. NetApp did not break out its all-flash storage sales for the quarter, but did say those sales rose 29 percent over those of the previous quarter to give the company an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. On a GAAP basis, NetApp reported net income of $243 million, or $1.03 per share, up slightly from last year's $241 million, or 93 cents per share. That beat analysts' expectations of 80 cents per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was reported at $257 million, or $1.09 per share, down from last year's $280 million, or $1.06 per share. That beat analysts' expectations of 94 cents per share.NetApp's CloudJumper Buy Will Tie VDI, Storage, Cloud: PartnersCommvault Accuses Rubrik, Cohesity Of Patent InfringementCohesity Closes $250 Million Funding Round, Including Support From HPE, CiscoKomprise Unveils Elastic Data Migration To Move Data Between On-Premises, CloudRubrik Taps ServiceNow CMO As Its First PresidentCognizant: Some Employee Email Access Lost After Maze AttackCognizant Left With ‘No Good Options’ After Maze Attack: Security ExpertHPE’s Antonio Neri: ‘Returning To The Office Will Be Voluntary’Cognizant Breach: 10 Things To Know About Maze Ransomware AttacksCoronavirus Relief: HPE, Aruba Suspend Partner Ready Revenue Targets ",
        "Is NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) Potentially Undervalued? – Simply Wall St News": " NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NetApp’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.  View our latest analysis for NetApp  According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 39%, trading at US$60.07 compared to my intrinsic value of $43.28. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NetApp’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.  Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of NetApp, it is expected to deliver a negative earnings growth of -13%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. It appears that risk of future uncertainty is high, at least in the near term. Are you a shareholder? If you believe NTAP is currently trading above its value, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. Given the risk from a negative growth outlook, this could be the right time to reduce your total portfolio risk. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed. Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NTAP for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. Price climbed passed its true value, in addition to a risky future outlook. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Should the price fall in the future, will you be well-informed enough to buy? Price is just the tip of the iceberg.

        "NetApp, Inc. Just Beat EPS By 28%: Here’s What Analysts Think Will Happen Next – Simply Wall St News": " Investors in NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) had a good week, as its shares rose 4.3% to close at US$61.98 following the release of its quarterly results. It looks like a credible result overall – although revenues of US$1.4b were what analysts expected, NetApp surprised by delivering a profit of US$1.03 per share, an impressive 28% above what analysts had forecast. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company’s performance, look at what top analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there’s been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what analysts are forecasting for next year.  View our latest analysis for NetApp  Following the recent earnings report, the consensus from26 analysts covering NetApp expects revenues of US$5.65b in 2020, implying a perceptible 2.0% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Earnings per share are expected to decline 13% to US$3.56 in the same period. In the lead-up to this report, analysts had been modelling revenues of US$5.65b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.43 in 2020. Analysts seem to have become more bullish on the business, judging by their new earnings per share estimates.  Analysts have been lifting their price targets on the back of the earnings upgrade, with the consensus price target rising 7.0% to US$58.23. That’s not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. Currently, the most bullish analyst values NetApp at US$75.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$40.00. Note the wide gap in analyst price targets? This implies to us that there is a fairly broad range of possible scenarios for the underlying business.  Another way to assess these estimates is by comparing them to past performance, and seeing whether analysts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the market. One thing that stands out from these estimates is that, even though revenues are forecast to keep falling, the decline is expected to accelerate. Analysts have modelled a 2.0% decline next year, compared to a historical decline of 0.01% per annum for the past five years. Compare this with our data on other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry, which in aggregate are forecast to see their revenue decline 5.1% per year. It seems clear that while revenues are expected to continue declining, analysts also expect the downturn to be more severe than that of the wider market.  The most important thing to take away from this is that analysts upgraded their earnings per share estimates, suggesting that there has been a clear increase in optimism towards NetApp following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although analyst forecasts imply revenues will perform worse than the wider market. There was also a nice increase in the price target, with analysts feeling that the intrinsic value of the business is improving.  With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company’s earnings is a lot more important than next year. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for NetApp going out to 2022, and you can see them free on our platform here..

        "Park Place Technologies Taps Former NetApp Exec As First Channel Chief": "Park Place Technologies has been moving to less focus on third-party maintenance and more on services, and the hiring of Jeff McCullough to build a formal channel program is expected to accelerate that movement. Park Place Technologies, a provider of third-party IT data center equipment management, has hired former NetApp channel chief Jeff McCullough to be its new global vice president of channel sales. \nMcCullough, who in September left storage vendor NetApp, is the first-ever channel chief for Cleveland, Ohio-based Park Place Technologies, and joins the company with a mandate to build its first formal channel program. While McCullough has only recently joined Park Place Technologies, he said the company is ready to formalize how it works with partners. \n[Related: Channel VP Jeff McCullough On How NetApp Partners Can Profit By Selling AWS, Azure, Google] \n\"This year, we will launch a new and richer channel program in terms of features and benefits,\" he told CRN. \"We have a small community of partners, and we want to get them more engaged.\" McCullough said the program will include a partner portal with such capabilities as deal registration, and will be positioned at helping Park Place Technologies and its partners grow their businesses. Currently, about half of Park Place Technologies' business goes through indirect channel partners, McCullough said. \"I've come to appreciate that half of this business is being transacted through the channel today with only a basic channel program,\" he said. \"But the company is interested in driving a channel vision. It has a view to drive growth through the channel. My job is to help take us to the next level by building a more aggressive program for the partners.\" Park Place Technologies has been on an acquisition spree, and in January made its thirteenth acquisition since 2016 with the acquisition of the network operations center (NOC) business of IntelliNet. McCullough said it was Park Place Technologies' August, 2019 acquisition of Entuity, a provider of network monitoring software, that really convinced him to seriously consider joining the company. \"What really stood out was the acquisition of Entuity,\" he said. \"That showed they were moving from a maintenance focus to a services focus,\" he said.With the hiring of McCullough to run a formal channel program, Park Place Technologies is taking a very proactive approach to the channel, said Deborah Bannworth, senior vice president of strategic alliances and inside sales at Sirius Computer Solutions, a San Antonio, Tex.-based solution provider. \"Historically, we've not seen a channel-first approach at Park Place,\" Bannworth told CRN. \"Jeff has a proven track record and experience with putting partners first. In my mind, the hiring of Jeff in that role is a clear indicator that Park Place Technologies is investing in its channel program.

        "Do You Know What NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) P/E Ratio Means? – Simply Wall St News": " The goal of this article is to teach you how to use price to earnings ratios (P/E ratios). To keep it practical, we’ll show how NetApp, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NTAP) P/E ratio could help you assess the value on offer. What is NetApp’s P/E ratio? Well, based on the last twelve months it is 15.27. That corresponds to an earnings yield of approximately 6.5%.  Check out our latest analysis for NetApp  The formula for price to earnings  is:  Price to Earnings Ratio = Price per Share ÷ Earnings per Share (EPS) Or for NetApp:P/E of 15.27 = USD62.42 ÷ USD4.09 (Based on the year to October 2019.)  A higher P/E ratio implies that investors pay a higher price for the earning power of the business. That isn’t a good or a bad thing on its own, but a high P/E means that buyers have a higher opinion of the business’s prospects, relative to stocks with a lower P/E.  One good way to get a quick read on what market participants expect of a company is to look at its P/E ratio. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (26.6) for companies in the tech industry is higher than NetApp’s P/E.  NetApp’s P/E tells us that market participants think it will not fare as well as its peers in the same industry. Many investors like to buy stocks when the market is pessimistic about their prospects. It is arguably worth checking if insiders are buying shares, because that might imply they believe the stock is undervalued.  P/E ratios primarily reflect market expectations around earnings growth rates. If earnings are growing quickly, then the ‘E’ in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. That means even if the current P/E is high, it will reduce over time if the share price stays flat. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.  NetApp’s 222% EPS improvement over the last year was like bamboo growth after rain; rapid and impressive. The sweetener is that the annual five year growth rate of 16% is also impressive. With that kind of growth rate we would generally expect a high P/E ratio.  Don’t forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. So it won’t reflect the advantage of cash, or disadvantage of debt. Theoretically, a business can improve its earnings (and produce a lower P/E in the future) by investing in growth. That means taking on debt (or spending its cash).  While growth expenditure doesn’t always pay off, the point is that it is a good option to have; but one that the P/E ratio ignores.  NetApp has net cash of US$1.4b. That should lead to a higher P/E than if it did have debt, because its strong balance sheets gives it more options.  NetApp has a P/E of 15.3. That’s below the average in the US market, which is 19.0. The net cash position gives plenty of options to the business, and the recent improvement in EPS is good to see. The below average P/E ratio suggests that market participants don’t believe the strong growth will continue.  When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. So this free report on the analyst consensus forecasts could help you make a master move on this stock.  Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with modest (or no) debt, trading on a P/E below 20.

Good afternoon, everyone.Before I get into our results for the third quarter, I want to take a moment to talk about Ron. Today, we announced that Ron has decided to retire by the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize his many contributions since joining NetApp in 2016. Under Ron's leadership, we have increased product margins by 10 points, nearly doubled our earnings power, and raised our dividend by over 100%. He has played a pivotal role in helping NetApp navigate a transformational period as we focus on becoming the leader in hybrid Cloud Data Services. I think you'll agree that he's always been a true and honest broker.Knowing that this is his last earnings call before he retires, it's certainly bittersweet for me. We continuously think about what's next for the Company, and that includes thoughtful, proactive succession planning. To that end, Ron and I have been talking about the prospect of this transition for some time. During the search process, we have been focused on finding the right person to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer. And I'm very pleased with the quality of candidates. I expect that we'll have someone enroll before the end of the quarter. Ron will stay on to ensure a seamless transition and I'm grateful for that.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you, George. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work alongside the talented team here at NetApp. These past four years have been incredibly rewarding. The team has proved to be collaborative, innovative and empowering, and I'm proud of what we have achieved during my time here. I also want to thank the investor and analyst community as it's been a genuine pleasure working with all of you. This is an exciting time for our industry and for NetApp, and I look forward to helping our next CFO transition in the roll.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThank you, Ron. Now, let's turn to an overview of the quarter. Despite the top line challenges, we continued our operational discipline, highlighted by strong gross margin, cash flow, and operating leverage without the benefit from anticipated ELA revenue in the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our business model as we take deliberate steps to better capitalize on our opportunity and return the Company to growth. However, macroeconomic headwinds and unpredictability in large enterprise purchasing behavior persist. Customers are on a journey to the cloud and they are looking to NetApp to help them as they grapple with the complexities of data management in hybrid multicloud IT environments. With our data fabric strategy, we help customers address these challenges, giving us access to new buyers and workloads, as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies, both large and small.We, not only have opportunity in the public cloud, but we also have increased our value for on-premises deployments. Our ability to deliver real business value to customers' hybrid multicloud environments fuels my confidence that we can return to growth. While we see exceptional opportunity ahead, we are planning our business, assuming no change in external factors for the foreseeable future. To improve our execution in this environment, we laid out a plan at the start of the fiscal year to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. We are on track to increase sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 fiscal year '21, without adding to the total operating expenses for the Company. The majority of the sales headcount will be deployed in our Americas geography. They will be focused on acquiring new accounts and engaging new buyers like cloud architects in existing accounts.We are seeing early signs of success by expanding our reach and focus on new customer acquisition. Our dedicated acquired districts continue to deliver strong growth across all metrics, sales, units and customers. The growth of these metrics accelerated in Q3, as did the growth of the pipeline pointing to continued progress in coming quarters. While the acquired districts performed well, we still need to broaden our share of wallet at our largest customers. We are making progress here. However, it is in our largest accounts, which have the greatest exposure to the macro that the demand environment is the least predictable.In Q3, our all-flash array business, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services increased from Q2 to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.3 billion. We introduced new all-flash array and hybrid flash array platforms, as well as the SAN-optimized all-flash array, which delivers a simplified and dedicated SAN experience.Our core storage offerings continue to gain industry accolades. Last quarter, NetApp took the highest ranking in the Leaders Quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. In Q3, NetApp was named a leader in IDC's File-Based Storage MarketScape with the recommendation that customers in need of hybrid cloud solutions should consider NetApp because of our expanded product portfolio, investments and vision.Our building blocks for private cloud deployments, SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID enable customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services, grew 10% from last quarter, attaining an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $350 million. To meet the increasing demand for object storage, NetApp announced new StorageGRID software, platforms and the ability to tier to Azure Blob storage. IDC named NetApp a leader in its Object-Based Storage MarketScape, citing our vast experience in unstructured data. They recommend customers consider StorageGRID when dealing with petabyte-scale data sets across various deployment locations because of its unique hybrid multicloud integrations.Based on the last month of Q3, our annualized recurring revenue for Cloud Data Services increased to approximately $83 million, up 146% year-over-year. We are now generally available with both Cloud Volumes Service and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for all the leading hyperscale cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services. Additionally, we added cloud compliance as a feature to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, which help customers comply with today's privacy and other data regulations. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services, as they enable us to acquire new customers and reach new buyers, as well as expand the data sets managed at existing customers. Our deep integration for a broad and growing range of use cases with the leading public clouds, and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions, gives us a sustainable competitive advantage.Let me share with you a few customer examples to illustrate how our data fabric strategy allows us to acquire new customers, expand our footprint at existing customers and increase our strategic value. A US-based research hospital, in one of our acquired districts, chose to go with NetApp on-premises and in the cloud. Our ability to connect their data centers to each other and to multiple public cloud providers, all with a consistent management interface, placed us well ahead of the competition in addressing the customer's requirement. A global retailer and current NetApp customer has halted its on-premises IT spending in favor of a cloud-first strategy. They plan to migrate their large SAP HANA environment to the cloud to gain flexibility and speed of scale using Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files. Because of our ability to help the customer easily migrate to the cloud, we will retain, not only the data currently managed by NetApp in their data centers, but we will also move competitor's on-premises footprints onto NetApp in the cloud.And finally, on our Q1 call, I told you that we were working with a Fortune 10 company to migrate its existing data centers to the cloud. That customer now has line of sight to move a 100 petabytes of data largely from our competitor systems to Azure NetApp Files. By partnering with them to achieve their cloud-first initiative, we have elevated NetApp from an infrastructure provider with a minority position in their data center to a key strategic partner. The power of our data fabric strategy increases our strategic relevance to customers, which creates long-term value for NetApp and our shareholders. It enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways, address new workloads and expand our presence with existing customers, and it drives our innovation agenda, which we advanced significantly in the quarter. We are delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers.Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio, and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. Our strong business model resulting from the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and our cost structure over the last several years, enables us to navigate the dynamics of the macro economy and customer demand environment, while making the strategic investments necessary to cement our leadership in hybrid Cloud Data Services.With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThanks, George. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q3, we delivered solid margins and operating leverage in the face of revenue weakness. Despite the demand uncertainty, we generated strong free cash flow and remain confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward.Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q3 performance. In Q3, net revenues of $1.4 billion, decreased 10% year-over-year. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter, although we had expected approximately $50 million. Product revenue of $787 million, decreased approximately 19% year-over-year.Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $556 million was up nearly 5% year-over-year, with better execution in our renewals business starting to deliver results. Deferred revenue increased 6% year-over-year in Q3.Gross margin of 67.8% was above our guidance. Product gross margin was 55%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline, an increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions.Q3 was the 12th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The Q2 to Q3 seasonal decrease in product margins was driven by customer and product mix. We've seen almost no degradation in product margins as a result of increased NAND pricing. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 83.6% increased nearly 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by continued productivity improvements.Q3 operating expenses of $640 million increased approximately 2% year-over-year driven by annual merit increases. Operating margin was 22.2% and in line with our guidance.EPS of $1.16 was down 3% year-over-year, but well within the guidance range.We closed Q3 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive one day, an increase of 12 days year-over-year. DSO of 53 days was up two days year-over-year. DIO was 22 days, an increase of seven days year-over-year. And DPO was 75 days down three days year-over-year.Cash flow from operations was $420 million. Free cash flow was $388 million, representing 28% of revenue. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020.During Q3, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $61.20 for a total of $500 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $640 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 229 million, down 26 million shares year-on-year, representing a 10% decrease.During the quarter, we paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $608 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share.Now, on to guidance. As we've noted over the past several quarters, the demand environment continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 4% decline in revenues year-over-year, including 0.5 point of currency headwind.Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%.We expect Q4 operating margin to range between 23% and 20%.We expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.28 and $1.36 per share, which at the midpoint implies an 8% increase year-over-year.The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies that total fiscal 2020 revenue will be down 10% with ELAs being approximately 1% of total revenues. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2020 gross margin of 67% to 68% and operating margin of approximately 21%. We expect fiscal 2020 EPS to be down approximately 7% year-over-year and within the range we guided last quarter.As George noted, we are seeing early signs of success from our strategic investments in sales coverage, which provides confidence in our ability to return the Company to long-term growth.I want to again thank the NetApp team, our shareholders, customers and partners for making the last four years a rewarding experience.With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Ron. We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator?OperatorThank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen.Karl Ackerman -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystHey, good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask a question. Ron, I guess, if -- I guess, I'm not sure what we should assume for ELA revenue in the April quarter guide. But even if we were to back out ELA revenue in the guide, it would seem that product gross margins will take a step-down by a couple hundred basis points. And so, I guess, am I missing something? And then secondarily, is that -- would that be based on component cost headwinds from NAND or are there other manufacturing costs we should be thinking about? Thank you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Karl. So, as you know, we don't guide product margins discreetly. But what we do have is about 1% of ELAs for the year in Q4, as opposed to what we had before as 2%. There's a lot of other -- so, first of all, in -- with respect to component costs, it's a very small amount we saw quarter-to-quarter from Q2 to Q3. That was a headwind to gross margin was one-tenth of 1%. So -- but there is a whole lot of other mix, right, there is mix by product if we have a higher flash mix, it tends to help margin, all things being equal, we have higher software mix, helps gross margin. So, there is a lot of dynamics under there. I wouldn't read anything into it with respect to component costs.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think with regard to the Q4 guide, the gross margin picture is affected by the fact that the mix between products and services leans more to products than it did in Q3. That's the typical seasonality that we see in a Q4 seasonal pattern. So, we are not seeing anything specific other than just the mix of products and services being a little different than it was this quarter.Karl Ackerman -- Cowen and Company -- AnalystThank you. Best of luck, Ron, and thanks. It's great to meet you and hope all is well. Thank you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Karl.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you, Karl. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs.Roderick Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystYeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Congratulations on the retirement, Ron. Good working with you. And I wanted to just go back to these ELAs. I'm calculating, if you're saying 1% of full year revenue, I mean, the exact calculation on that, it's about $55 million. I'm assuming this is a rough estimate, it could be $50 million. But just three months ago you guys thought of the $100 million. And I just -- I'm just wondering why you continue to think you've got visibility here and we have so much uncertainty on these ELAs. And why include them in the guidance given all that?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerWe can see some of them. They are still difficult to predict. But -- and they always were back-end loaded. So some of the ones that we expect in Q4 probably going to slip out of the year. That's really it. But it's a very different year than last year. Last year they're front-end loaded. This year they're back-end loaded. As we told you, they are difficult to predict in a quarter. And then if they come at the end of the year they are difficult to predict and really going to come in the year. So, it's just that simple. Having said all that, we still are really happy with the gross margin performance and the underlying product revenue. It's very strong, it won't be a headwind because of a lot of the ELAs year-to-year.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think as Ron said, Rod, these ELAs are meant to make it easier for the customer to buy, and they benefit from the structure of the ELAs to being able to buy more product more easily. We've always said they are choppy and hard to predict. We have deep engagements with their customers that we are structuring ELAs with. And we had -- we thought one in the quarter that has moved out and that's why we've also taken down the range from 2% to 1%. So, we're trying to do the best we can to give you a view of what's available and we're balancing that with the probability that some of them may not happen in the year.Roderick Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystCould you guys elaborate -- I mean, you say it's one, George. Is this just a few ELA deals that would have amounted to $100 million -- the $55 million, maybe that's a couple of deals? Or can you give us any idea on that?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, I think these are, by nature, large transactions with a very few customers, right? It's 1% or 2% of our total revenue is not a large number, and the number of those transactions are very, very few. So, each of them are lumpy, hard to predict and sizable, and I'll just leave it there. Right?Roderick Hall -- Goldman Sachs -- AnalystOkay. All right. Thank you, guys.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Rod. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystHi, yes. Thank you. I know you just guided Q4, but can you give us any sense at all on how we should look at fiscal '21? You have NAND pricing moving up again, your compares are quite easy, Cloud Data Services seems to be doing better. Can you give us some guideposts on fiscal '21, talk about maybe at least some of the puts and takes on revenue and also on gross margins, if you could, please?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, let me just kind of -- we're not going to guide the next fiscal year. We'll give you that guidance when we actually guide it. I can tell you that, first of all, the investments we are making in additional sales coverage, we are on track against our target of 200 incremental sales headcount, covering new accounts and driving customer acquisition by the end of Q1 fiscal year '20. It takes those sales reps roughly four quarters to get productive. So the majority of the productivity will show up next year, which should drive the year-on-year model to be favorable relative to what we had this year. And we are seeing the early payoff of some of the investments we made in acquisition accounts and acquisition districts as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, showing up positively and accelerating through the course of the year.With regard to product gross margins, as Ron mentioned, we have been maintaining strong margins across the board, both on product and services, reflecting the differentiation of our offerings, the work that we've done in terms of driving productivity in the business and the discipline of our sales force to capture the full value of our offerings. And we think that regardless of the ELA picture, we have a sound business model on the gross margin side. We have been disciplined in our operating expenses. As we said, we have outlaid the sales headcount without adding to the operating expense structure of the Company and we'll tell you more about our plans for how we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses next year. But overall, the business model of the Company is a strong one. I have every confidence that on the top line, the investments we're making this year, together with our really strong product portfolio, should drive positive territory next year.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystGeorge, appreciate that color. If I could really quick. On the ELAs, what is the hesitancy that you're seeing at the customer base, particularly because they don't necessarily have to shell out the cash upfront? So why is this not an indication that they are kicking the tires around other products or how should people read this hesitancy around signing ELAs?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think, first of all, with regard to our competitive position, the data that we mentioned about our ability to win new accounts and gain share in new districts, proves that we have strong competitive position. With regard to these accounts that we are doing ELA discussions with, we are deeply, deeply involved in those accounts. We've got many years of experience dealing with them and we don't see that they are headed to an alternate architecture or alternate buying motion. I think these transactions are complex. They require coordination across many departments in the customer. We've always been transparent about the fact that they are lumpy, right, and there is very few of them. So, my own view is ELAs are 1% to 2% of our business. The majority of the business is an extremely healthy. These customers that we are in discussions with, we have other ways to pursue meeting their needs beyond the ELAs and we are using that in other parts of some of these accounts. So, we'll tell you more as the ELAs come through and we get more visibility into some of these discussions going forward.Wamsi Mohan -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Wamsi. Next question?OperatorNext question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.Kathryn Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you. Good afternoon. Just looking at the product revenue trajectory, the decline accelerated in the January quarter despite an easier compare. Can you just talk about where you saw some of the incremental weakness in January?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWell, I think the ELA was a contributing factor to the decline. I think if the ELA had been -- had come in, I think the picture would have been quite different, Katy.I think with regard to the weakness in product revenue, which continues to be in the largest enterprises. As we have said, those are the ones that are most affected by uncertain macroeconomic buying conditions. And we are trying to balance our exposure to those accounts by acquiring new accounts. We've seen good results from that. And hopefully, those two lines should crossover at some point in the near future.Kathryn Huberty -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystThank you. Ron, congratulations on your retirement.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Katy.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Katy. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.Timothy Long -- Barclays -- AnalystThank you. Congratulation as well, Ron. George, Ron, I just wanted to ask about the Cloud Data Services business. It is kind of moving higher, but it seems like in the last few quarters, you've been adding more partners that you GA add and more products and solutions, and I think we're at pretty much four quarters in a row where the kind of the sequential growth was about $10 million, give or take, $1 million in that line. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you think it will take for that line to inflect a little bit more? Is it more experience with the partners or other products? Or what do you think it will be that will make that line start to move a little more aggressively higher? Thank you.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentThanks for the question. There are two things that we believe will allow us to move that line up. I think the first is, we continue to do enablement and training, and we are acquiring more new customers every single day. These workloads or applications that we serve in the public cloud, they are important applications, right? They are mission-critical applications, high-performance applications. And so, it takes a while for the customer to get comfortable with the usage of our technology before they adopt and expand. We are seeing some of the early customers who did proof of concepts with us started to move some workloads, now starting to broaden their book of business. So that will take a bit of ramp time.The second is, due to overwhelming demand and the fact that operationally we are in the early phases of a multi-region global rollout, we have a process that we've agreed on, with the hyperscale cloud provider, which is, we call -- which they call white-listing, where the customer requires a registration for us to manually approve them being on-boarded. We are in a window where we're working hard to remove white-listing and that will allow us to scale demand more -- in a much more automated fashion. So those are the two key things that we need to get through to be able to scale it even faster.Timothy Long -- Barclays -- AnalystOkay. And I assume we're still on track with the long-term target here?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWe have clearly signs of the favorable demand patterns. We see that the market opportunity is clearly there to get. And that's clearly our goal and intent. As we said, we are about a year behind where we wanted to be because of the time it's taken us to get these services to production readiness. And so, we're going to continue to push to see how we can get to that target. And we'll keep you updated on progress.Timothy Long -- Barclays -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Tim. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystYeah. Thanks for taking the question. And also congratulations, Ron. It's been great working with you. I apologize to go back to this discussion, but maybe just trying to understand the math a little bit more, given I think the questions, I'll get is, if I look at the lumpiness in the ELA business and I appreciate that, that lumpiness will continue. I think it's important just to kind of understand what you're saying about the gross margin. So, if I assume the ELA gross margin is close to 100%, it seems like your implicit guide on gross margin is back into the mid-65% range. So, I guess, what I'm asking is, what am I missing? And I can appreciate the mix of the business is a variable in the April quarter, but I'm just trying to think about if ELAs aren't there, how do we think about that gross margin structure going through the course of the next couple of quarters?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSo we guided gross margin for the quarter between 66% and 67%. Last quarter for Q3, it was closer to 68%. You have a higher mix of product revenue in Q4. That's the biggest degradation to margins. There is a -- without going into specific number, the product margin guide employed in that is actually higher than Q3 because of the ELA. So, it is -- just -- you can't see all this, but I'm telling you, it actually holds together. So...Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOkay. And the ELA -- I know that ELA attributes, there is a fact said after the upfront software contributions, that actually, you have some hardware-only revenue that kicks in, that has lower margins. That's not a variable at this point?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThat's right. That's kind of the variable. You've got -- as I said earlier, you got mix now. We didn't historically have a mix difference in margin between all-flash and hybrid and now we do. There is a big difference between what you sell all-flash in the margin versus hybrid. Plus the mix of software is a wild card. So last quarter, in Q3, we saw software being less of the total than we did in Q2. And that was a little bit of the degradation. So there's a lot of dynamics going on under there.Aaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystOkay. Thank you very much.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSure.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Aaron. Next question?OperatorOur next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystThanks for taking my questions. And Ron, it was very nice working you, and good luck with your next endeavor. George, when I look at your guide for the April quarter, and I'd just make some assumption for the all-flash array. It seems like you're going to exit FY'20 with a high-single-digit decline in all-flash array revenues. So as you reposition the sales force and you reload, how should we think about the embedded growth assumption for this particular area of flash array? Are we going to -- are we set out for a double-digit growth? And if so, what gives you the confidence other than just hiring 200 more salespeople? And I have a follow-up.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think this year the all-flash array business has been affected in two dimensions. One was the fact that our largest customers who were most impacted by the macro were heavily all-flash customers. So from a product mix perspective, the fact that our biggest accounts underperformed or bought less impacted our all-flash business more substantially than it impacted pretty much every other product in the Company. The second is that, the ELAs were also heavily all-flash-oriented. So, both of those have been contributing factors to the year-on-year declines in the all-flash category.We expect the work that we're doing with the deployment of additional sales force resources, as well as focusing our compensation plans and our sales objectives on returning to growth in the all-flash category to be able to drive our business at and above market growth rates. And we'll tell you more about that as we issue the FY'21 guide. But we are taking actions to focus our sales force on the best-in-class product in the all-flash category, which is ours, right? And we have every confidence that we should be able to meet or beat the market next year.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystSure. And a quick follow-up. I understand ELAs have a material impact on product margin. But excluding ELA, NAND prices are going to go up and they're going to go up much higher than where they are today. So how are you able to manage product gross margin independent of ELA? Because I perceive ELAs as volatile and there's no way I could model that. So I just want to think about the increase in bill of material and how you're going to be able to manage that?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSo, Mehdi, two things: number one is, as you saw this quarter, I think quarter-to-quarter NAND prices went up about 4% and have a very minimal effect on our gross margin, because contrary to popular belief, not a big, huge portion of the COGS in our system is actually NAND, right? A lot of it's software, a lot of it's other parts. So, I think what you should see this year is -- you're right, this year we should project to see NAND go up, but it won't have a huge material effect on gross margin because there's a lot of other components.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystAnd is that because you're able to -- that there is another replacement cycle coming? Is there a premium? Because on the margin, NAND [Phonetic] is going higher. I understand NAND is a small portion, but it's still going higher.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, I think, first of all, for the drives in our platforms, we typically pass the cost on to our customers, right? I think NAND is not an embedded component of our system, it is a consumable that we pass on to customers. And so, we don't try to mask the commodities in terms of the drives in our system. And so, there will be -- at some point, as the market adjusts upward, if that is the trajectory, we're going to be discrete about making sure that we pass on some of that to our customers, right? And so, we've had that history. I think the industry as a whole has had that history. And we'll disclose it when we do it, right?I think with regard to product gross margins, they've been strong this year, and even without ELAs, because of the fact that our sales force has been enabled and we know how to sell the value of our offerings. A substantial portion of that value is actually software that both makes our systems the most efficient in the industry, but also allows our customers to uniquely take advantage of hybrid cloud capability that nobody else in the industry has. And so, we are differentiated in software. That's proven out in the ability to hold gross margins in a tough economic environment.Mehdi Hosseini -- Susquehanna International Group -- AnalystClear. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question?OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.Matthew Cabral -- Credit Suisse -- AnalystYeah. Thank you. George, can you just talk a little bit about the wider demand environment that you're seeing and if it's changed at all versus the prior few quarters? And then, I guess, given it's been about a year since you've been calling out macro as a headwind, what gives you confidence that these larger deals are just actually being pushed as opposed to either competitive losses or some sort of a secular shift in customers thinking about their on-prem footprint more broadly?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo, we saw the first signs of the macro being a little bit more choppy was about a year ago in January. We saw a substantial step-down from that level of uncertainty into a much more sort of uncertain environment in Q1. I think from Q1 -- of our fiscal Q1. I think from then on it's stayed relatively in the same territory. I wouldn't say it has gotten worse. It is reflective of three or four key things. I think the first is, buying cycles are longer and the amount of spend per transaction is smaller. I think we have consistently seen a higher rate and number of transactions across a broader range of accounts, especially as we've added sales capacity through the year. And so, that's indications that we can win in net new accounts, but that the average transaction size is more muted. You also see the fact, as we've said, where people are buying for now versus buying capacity for the long-term. Even though you hand people incentives to buy a larger transaction, they're more sort of comfortable buying for the short-term. Those are some of the key things.With regard to what gives us confidence that we can return to growth, listen, I think, first of all, we have relatively easy compares in the first half of next year. We've put in capacity ahead of that window to get our sales teams productive. We've got work to do to enable all the 200 that we put in place. But the results from the new deployments of resources in terms of customer wins, units, sales volume, use cases, have all been really encouraging.With regard to these large customers that we are engaged with, we have deep relationships with them. We know when they're making an architectural choice to go to the cloud, because we are an intimate part of those cloud discussions with many. And frankly, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of them going to cloud might be a near-term hindrance to revenue growth, but they give us a much broader revenue opportunity in the medium-term, right? We mentioned the Fortune 10 company, which as they've moved to cloud has given us a maybe 3 times to 4 times larger opportunity than we had on-premises. And so, we're excited about that opportunity in those accounts that are choosing to move to cloud.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Matt. Next question?OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- AnalystHi. Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Ron, from me as well congratulations, it's been great working with you. Really enjoyed it.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you. Appreciate that.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- AnalystAnd -- yeah. You're welcome. George, I know you just said that you don't -- at least broadly speaking, you don't think that you're seeing the spending environment get more challenging. Could you -- like, if I back out the ELAs from the strategic revenue, you put up slightly sort of more favorable declines in the Jan quarter, but it was off a meaningfully easier compare. And so, I don't know, the numbers seem to suggest that like maybe there is some incremental interference in the spending environment. So, I just want to run that by you and just make sure that I understood your comment accurately.And then, I'm just going to add one more in there too. Do you feel like with the new sales force ramp-on that you're where you -- from a productivity perspective, that you're where you want it to be at this point? If you could update us there? Just I think we're all just looking for kind of context around the -- not just the product revenue, but the strategic product revenue spending dynamic. Thanks.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, I think that we're seeing the environment is choppy, right? We are seeing that customer spending, enterprise IT spending for on-premises data centers is choppy and that has been true for a few quarters now. Do I have enough data to say, it's a shade better or a shade worse? I don't have that data, right? I'm just saying it is pretty choppy and uncertain.I think with regard to the sales force productivity, we've always said it's between three and four quarters, roughly four quarters for a new account manager to be fully trained and equipped and ready. We said that we would be adding increments of 50 headcount starting in Q2 of fiscal year '20 and finishing at the end of Q1 fiscal year '21. So we would have four chunks of that. We are on track with the hiring, and we're working hard on enablement, right? And so, I think if you do the math the majority of the productivity impact of that headcount is actually next fiscal year. And listen, we'd love to move the productivity impact earlier and we're doing everything we can, but I think that's where we -- you should reasonably model it.Ananda Baruah -- Loop Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Okay, great. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Ananda. Next question?OperatorOur next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.Matthew Sheerin -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- AnalystYes. Thank you. I wanted to ask about any potential impact you're seeing from the coronavirus in your supply chain, given that most of your key suppliers are in Asia, in China. So, any constraints there? Or given that you're still early in the quarter, and you tend to be more back-end loaded by the time you get through the quarter that shouldn't be an issue?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, our Q4 revenue guide does not include any disruption to our supply chain from the coronavirus. So far, two elements of our business and their potential impact on coronavirus, right? On the demand side, we don't have a large business in China. We, as you know, prosecute that business through a joint venture with Lenovo, who are the distributors of our technology in China. Our customers are -- do large amounts of business in China, so I would model on the demand side that our impact to us is a second-order derivative, right?With regard to the supply side, with regard to our supply chain, yes, we like others have supply base that is built -- that has a meaningful footprint in China. And we are working pretty hard on contingency planning to minimize disruptions. So far, we have not seen any, but I think there's probably likely some and we're working hard to minimize that.Matthew Sheerin -- Stifel, Nicolaus & Company -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystThanks. Good afternoon. Congrats Ron on your retirement. I'm thinking you might have a future as a NAND analyst going forward. You may not like the job.In terms of questions, I was just curious, this may be in the rounding of the numbers, but it looks like sales through channel, the channel were a little weaker year-over-year. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about that. And also, a similar question on the public sector markets, was there any changes relative to your expectations there? It seemed like it came off a real -- regular sort of end to the -- their October fiscal year? Thank you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerSo with respect to the mix of channel, I mean, that vacillates -- it's usually 80-20, that should vacillates around that mean. There's nothing underlying there that was -- is permanent or unusual.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystOkay. Thanks.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to the public sector business, mostly performed according to plan. I think we saw a pretty normal pattern of business in our public sector.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystAnd just as a follow-up to that, any initiatives to sort of maybe reaccelerate your business there? I know, one of your smaller competitors has been focusing on that area. Do you see that as a threat? Or is this more just tied to general budgets?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, I think we have a variety of ways to broaden our relevance in the public sector. We are working with some of our cloud provider partners to be part of their initiatives and to serve our men and women in uniform in new and interesting ways. So, we'll tell you more about that as we bring those to market.Steven Fox -- Cross Research -- AnalystOkay. Thank you very much.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you, Steve. Next question?OperatorThank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.Jim Suva -- Citigroup -- AnalystThanks very much. George, if I remember right, it was approximately six months ago you had mentioned about increasing sales force by 200 and you mentioned it again. I was just wondering, is the tempo or the cadence of that going faster than expected, in line with expected, slower than expected? Because what I'm trying to do is figure out the softer guidance. Is it being impacted at all by that sales force transition? Or is it more macro and just longer decision-making timelines? Thank you so much.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentWith regard to the sales force, we said that we would add 200 incremental sales resources to allow us to acquire new customers. We laid that out in four quarters sort of saying that we would start in Q2 of fiscal -- of this fiscal year and finish at the end of Q1 of fiscal year '21, and we are on track. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are bringing good candidates on-board and we are generally on track. We also said that it would take a typical new sales rep about four quarters to get productive. So if you do the math, the majority of the benefits of that investment really are next year, right?With regard to Q4, the change or the softness is really for us being a little bit more conservative on ELAs going from previously what we thought would be 2% down to 1%, maybe a shade below 1% in that range, right? And so, I think that's the majority of the change between what you saw previously and what you see now.Jim Suva -- Citigroup -- AnalystThank you so much for the clarifications and detail, that's greatly appreciated. And Ron, we'll greatly miss you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerThank you. Appreciate it, Jim.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Jim. Next question?OperatorOur next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James & Associates -- AnalystThank you for taking the question, and Ron, congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to see if we can maybe talk about your overall philosophy regarding return of capital. You've been buying back a lot of stock, another $500 million this quarter, paying a good dividend over $100 million. And so, you've been exceeding your free cash flow and you're almost out of the authorized $600 million. So, I assume you're going to update us on that at some point. But, I guess, what I'm trying to get to is the long-term philosophy. And does the transition of CFO mean that you'll want to wait for the new CFO to set a philosophy? Or how are you thinking? Thank you.Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerWell, yeah, I think it's going to coincide with the change in the fiscal year, when we give the guide. Obviously, we'll give some clarity around what would happen to the capital allocation policy. But the dividend is permanent, that's not going to change. If anything it's going to go up as we proceed from here on out. And to your point, we're almost done with the $4 billion share repurchase. So, you could see that getting to an end fairly soon and the Company will probably reclarify what the next tranche will be going forward. And I'll let my successor determine that with George.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI'll just say that Ron and I have had a common philosophy and a shared one around the sources and uses of cash. I don't think you should see a radical departure from our belief that cash is an important asset for both investing in the long-term health of the business and in terms of providing returns to shareholders. So, I don't think that you should see us make a radical departure from that philosophy go-forward.Simon Leopold -- Raymond James & Associates -- AnalystGreat. Thank you. That's helpful.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Simon. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.Louis Miscioscia -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Thank you. Ron, best of luck. It's good having you. So, I wanted to just -- and I went back further 10 years, but really want to focus on the last seven years. If I take out the ELAs for the quarter just to look at product revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the average growth is actually about $39 million if I'm getting this all right. And with that, four out of the last seven actually were material misses, and the other three were just basically hitting, let's say, $73 million to $77 million quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, I'd be just a little worried on even this lower product revenue taking out ELAs. So, again, given the choppy environment and all the uncertainty, why would we -- why would you be able to hit that midpoint?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentYou're talking about Q4? Lou?Louis Miscioscia -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystQ4 over Q3, yes, sequential growth of product revenue to get to the -- if I'm modeling very easily software maintenance and services, I don't think they're hard to model. And thus, when I look at product revenue, I take out the $50 million, again, it seems like your average was $39 million quarter-to-quarter.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentSo, Q4 has always been the strongest quarter in terms of a year-end finish for our sales force. I think we have done a good amount of work in terms of looking at our pipeline. And we're not saying that the guide isn't requires really good execution and it doesn't require disruption due to coronavirus or anything else. But I think that we're counting on the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year and Q4 is the quarter that those sales reps that are in the money are going to bring in transactions, right? I think that's the short summary.I think like all plans, we go into the quarter looking at our pipeline, looking at close rates, looking at how many transactions that are high probability, medium probability, low probability are required to get in these numbers and we've done that work. It is a choppy environment. And so, we've tried to be cautious around the probabilities, but we've done -- we're doing as much due diligence as we can with regard to the quality of the bookings forecast that we give you.Louis Miscioscia -- Daiwa Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Lou. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street Capital Markets -- AnalystYeah. You've given us some good clarity on the sales hiring effort. I was just curious where did our headcount finish up for January 31. And where do you expect it ending the fiscal year? Total?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerIt was roughly flat. It hasn't changed all that much. We haven't been in a hiring mode except on the sales force side. We're holding opex essentially flat this fiscal year. Some of that is variable comp, but it obviously implies that we're not adding a lot of people just in certain areas and rather surgically.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. You guys normally have a college hiring cycle that would probably bring on people in Q1. Are you continuing to pursue that? Or are you -- has that been kind of suspended?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerNo, that's ongoing.Eric Martinuzzi -- Lake Street Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThanks, Eric. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research.Nikolay Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystHi, guys. Good afternoon. George, we're continuing -- we're hearing that HCI Systems are displacing more and more traditional servers and storage systems. So, I guess, that that suggests that the market could be moving to that enterprise scale applications that your product addresses. But can you provide us with your outlook for 2020 in terms of -- do you expect to see an inflection in your HCI revenue in the next year?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentListen, HCI addresses some of the use cases in the customers' data center, particularly ones that are single application use. I think that we have a good offering. It's differentiated for mixed workloads and has several elements for customers who require good data management capabilities even in a single application use. And we're focusing our efforts in HCI in that part of the market.We don't see HCI displacing sort of the core of solid-state storage, right? I think fiber channel storage, as well as high-performance scale-out NFS storage is still got many, many applications in the data center. And our original view that HCI might displace those isn't being proven true. And I think you'll see us push aggressively with our flash and hybrid flash products to address those use cases.Nikolay Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystGot it. If I can follow-up just quickly, are you willing to share what percent of customers are still at a proof-of-concept stage with CDS?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentNo, it's too early to comment on that. I think I would just tell you the majority of our customers today on CDS are in early production, right? So, they're in -- you could say they're in proof-of-concept of their first application deployment on our platform. And they might be in production on that application, but that's the first of many. They want to move to that platform. So, broadly speaking, until we sort of remove ungated demand, which is removing what we call white-listing, every customer is in sort of a proof-of-concept mode. And once we remove that, you should be able to see much more automated on-boarding of customers to that platform.Nikolay Todorov -- Longbow Research -- AnalystGot it. Thanks, guys. Good luck, Ron.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsThank you, Nik. Next question?OperatorOur next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.George Iwanyc -- Oppenheimer & Co. -- AnalystThank you for taking my question. And best of luck, Ron. George, could you maybe give us a bit more color on trends in North America? Are there any areas where you're seeing market share gains from a workload perspective? Are you starting to see any benefit from the streamlined purchasing model?George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentI think with regard to the use of consumption and consumption-based offerings, we see that our Cloud Data Services, plus managed services from partners are really good opportunities for customers to get going with us in a consumption offering. I think we made our subscription-type model available. We're seeing early interest that's very healthy, and we are working with a small group of customers on proof-of-concepts, getting them on-board and going from there.With regard to the streamlined pricing and packaging of our platforms, I think that's a big part of why product gross margins continue to be healthy, right? I think that customers are able to understand the value that we offer in a much more streamlined way than we historically used to. And so, it's another support element for product gross margins helping our sales force establish value with customers.With regard to some of the shifts we see going on in the market, as I mentioned, we are participating with the hyperscaler cloud providers in new market opportunities and especially in the public sector market. We'll tell you more about it as those become real, but they expand our total addressable market opportunity in a way that we didn't before.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, George. Next question?OperatorThank you. And our final question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim.Nehal Chokshi -- Maxim Group -- AnalystYeah. Thank you. The year-over-year trajectory on the hardware maintenance went from declining mid-single digits to flat. Is there a narrative behind that?Ronald J. Pasek -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So actually if you remember even in Q1 and Q2 adjusting for currency, we were flat. This quarter it's up about 5%. What I tried to put in my prepared remarks and we've actually started to see the benefits of some of the work, we've been doing on renewals, so it's finally starting to pay off. Better renewal rates, better structures, better pricing, better discounting, so you'll have to wait until next year, but that's actually a bright spot, that trend line is actually in really good shape.Nehal Chokshi -- Maxim Group -- AnalystOkay. Thank you.Kris Newton -- Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor RelationsAll right. Thanks, Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some final comments.George Kurian -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentOur Data Fabric strategy is creating value for our customers, NetApp and our investors. Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT.

NetApp reported fiscal third-quarter earnings of $277 million, or $1.21 a share, on sales of $1.4 billion, after posting earnings of 98 cents a share on sales of $1.56 billion a year ago. After factoring in stock-based compensation, some tax effects and amortization, NetApp reported earnings of $1.16 a share. Analysts on average expected NetApp to report adjusted earnings of $1.18 a share on sales of $1.46 billion. NetApp's fourth-quarter forecast was also slightly off from expectations -- the company said it expects to record adjusted earnings of $1.28 to $1.36 a share on revenue of $1.46 billion to $1.61 billion, while analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.39 a share on sales of $1.57 billion. The company also announced that CFO Ron Pasek plans to retire by the end of the fiscal year, and NetApp intends to name a successor by that time.
