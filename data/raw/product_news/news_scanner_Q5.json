You've seen the slew of third-party scanner apps you have to pay for in the App Store. Which one to choose?But wait! Before you do that ... did you know Apple put a free, built-in scanner right in your iPhone?I was today years old when I learned you can scan documents in the Notes app on the phone.‚Äî üò∫ Cat Jacques üò∫ (@CatJacquesESPN) April 7, 2020That‚Äôs right. With the release of iOS 11 back in 2017, Apple rolled out a scanner right within the Notes app. It‚Äôs right there waiting for you to use it, and it costs nothing.Apparently, a bunch of people had no idea there‚Äôs been a scanner hidden in their iPhone for years.¬†wtf the notes app has a document scanner since fucking when‚Äî emmaüßùüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è (@beanpixiee) April 4, 2020If that was you, well, now you know! Here‚Äôs how to use your iPhone‚Äôs scanner:Go to Apple‚Äôs official Notes app on your iPhone.Open an existing note, or create a new one by clicking the little icon on the lower right-hand side of the device.Tap on the camera icon in the menu that appears.Choose \"Scan Documents\" from the options that pop up.Hold your phone in front of the document you want to scan.If the scanner is in auto mode, the app will automatically detect the document and capture the scan. In manual mode, you‚Äôll have to snap a photo yourself. You can change which mode you‚Äôre in on the upper right-hand side of the screen.If you need to adjust the scan, you can drag the corners of the page.Keep scanning if you have additional pages, or tap on \"Retake\" to automatically discard an image and rescan it.Hit \"Save\" on the lower right-hand side when you‚Äôre done. You now have a PDF of your document.After scanning the document, you have a number of editing options. You can crop it, switch between a color or black-and-white scan, rotate the document, and add additional pages to the scan. Tap on the name of the document to change the file name at any time.Once the scanned document is sitting in your note, click on the \"Share\" button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen to send your PDF wherever it needs to go. You can also use the markup option and add your signature or input text. This is obviously handy if the document you scanned is a form you need to fill out.There you have it. No need to buy a third-party app from the App Store. Just use the scanner that‚Äôs been sitting on your iPhone this whole time.",

Maybe not at first, they might have thought he was another police officer being clean-cut and all. Being from the area myself I have seen first hand what happens to someone who attempts to injure a police officer so \"Yes\" I know fights are a little different especially involving kids like I once was so very long ago some. Police Officers will have mutual combat in order to teach an already well-known lesson, in fact, there was a song written about it it goes something like this \"I fought da Law and the Law Won.\" I know that song very well like a basketball dribbling echo's in my head from several dozen past lives. I don't give a shit about getting downvoted. I used the reference to Chicago for the Bozo's who compare North Counties Gang Violence to Chicago's Gang Violence considering that some gang members in my former neck of the woods have BBQed and eaten a member or two to get rid of the evidence of their kill by using a human wood chipper Anyway it is what it is. I think for all the Hoopla made about this case $35,000 is a very low bail for this guy but it just makes me wonder is all. As far as the opinions of the Ignorant ones I always know what they are going to say being downvoted out is a feather in my cap of righteousness here in Paradise of my Milpas Underpanties...HERE IS YOUR SCANNER REPORTS.Scanner Reports, Monday:¬†Scanner Reports, Tuesday:¬†I'm starting to stress out on all this handwashing and mask-wearing crap, my age spots are fading from all the handwashing. I must wash my hands 40 times a day and I don't go anywhere. The masks are getting so old they are sinking into my face the whole thing is horribly frustrating sometimes I have to yell too! Like all the 5150's out there maybe they are more frustrated than nuts. I don't think it's ever going to get back to the way things used to be. We're going to have to wear these Fucking masks forever and wear these gloves. I don't want to go anywhere anymore yet every time I do go somewhere not everyone is wearing a mask or gloves? I hear a lot of calls on the scanner Medical Emergency calls, Suicide calls, People losing their mind calls, people who haven't been seen for days, and days calls because they are hiding. I have horrible anxiety and anger this kind of shit brings out the BEAST in people.

I have two boxes if you need them. \nI do and I have thick blue rubber gloves that are smaller than my hand medium the box is open but there is 15-20 pairs in there... \nAs long as you stay in your own little citadel and aren't going outside, you don't have to be washing your hands so much that you ruin them.   When you bring stuff like groceries inside, wipe articles down with soap&water mix and let them sit awhile is what I do, and wash your hands.  I let the mail sit in the sun for an hour tho' supposedly that is not necessary, and wash my hands when first fetching the mail.  Otherwise, I don't wash my hands inside, besides entering and leaving the bathroom.     \nAfter I pet Joey I wash my hands he washes his paws... \nThat might have been an SBSD call...Some days they are busier than others getting alittle crazy out there. \nA while back, I told Police, that were in the area,  about a bunch of bicycles  in the bushes, and they weren't interested !!!!   Same with the big fake book, which turned out  to be a big box of drugs.   Police weren't interested.    \n Voted Santa Barbara's Best Website for 10 years in a row, edhat is local news from your communityTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCommenting Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nCommenting Policy\nCommenting Policy",

While you may be tempted to pick up this rugged device, the main audience for it is companies and their employees as it's packed with multiple business-oriented features.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Xcover Pro now available in the USThe phone is launching on the Verizon network with support for the carrier‚Äôs Push To Talk Plus service. Later on, the Microsoft Teams software will be updated to support the Walkie Talkie feature. Another incoming update will enable the second SIM slot on the phone.Microsoft Teams already supports Shifts, Tasks and Praise, which helps managers organize teams. The phone has pogo pins for charging so you can put it on a dock at the end of your shift and it will be ready for the next shift (thanks to 18W fast charging). The software natively supports being shared by two employees. And if heavy use depletes the 4,050mAh battery before the day is over, it can easily be swapped out with a spare.\n\n\nMobile point of sale functionality ‚Ä¢ Barcode scanningThe phone has a built-in camera-based barcode scanner and is compatible with several laser-based scanner accessories that can turn this into a mobile point of sale system. There‚Äôs also NFC with enhanced security and reliability features, including EMV Level 1 (it stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa).The Galaxy Xcover Pro can go out in the field with you as it is rated for drops from 1.5m heights (MIL-STD-810 certified) and can survive 1.5m underwater for 30 minutes (IP68). The 6.3‚Äù 1080p+ AMOLED screen has a Glove mode and can detect touches from wet fingers. There are also two programmable keys, which can act as shortcuts for the most commonly used functions.\n\n\n\nSamsung Galaxy Xcover ProThe phone is available online through Samsung, Verizon and Microsoft (as well as other distributors) and can be bought unlocked. Brick and mortar stores will get it soon.This really is a device for companies, mind, and companies like assurance that products they depend on will not be discontinued quickly. Samsung commits to keeping the Xcover Pro available for at least two years and releasing security updates for it for three years.PS. don‚Äôt confuse this with the Galaxy Xcover FieldPro which also became available in the US earlier this month. The FieldPro is a more premium offering (still aimed at companies rather than individuals) and goes for over $1,000.Sourceoh my gosh, they totally ;) copy everything, especially when apple says that someone copy's them but loses the lawsuit! if any thing, apple is copying them! Wallpaper taken strait from iPhone hehe.. After all this years, Samsung still copying Apple, what a shame (same goes for giant S20 ultra back camera design). Security patches for only 3 years? How does that translate to them wanting to keep the phone around for longer than other \"regular\" phones! \n\n\nPhone finder\n\n\n\nAll brands\n\n\n\nRumor mill\n\n\nHome\nNews\nReviews\nCompare\nCoverage\nGlossary\nFAQ\nRSS feed\r\n¬© 2000-2020 GSMArena.com\nMobile version\nAndroid app\nContact us\nPrivacy\nTerms of use\n",

Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services‚Äô Standards Division says.The store at 304 S. Poplar St. was inspected in November. Among 50 items, there was a 12 percent error rate based on six overcharges, a release says. Inspected again in December, this time with 300 items, a 3 percent error rate was found on nine overcharges.The state fined Family Dollar $1,035, and the penalty has been paid. The store passed inspection in February.‚ÄúThe price on the shelf and the price at the register should match,‚Äù said Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler. ‚ÄúStores have a responsibility to make sure their pricing is accurate, and most stores pass inspection. Ones with errors face fines until they come into compliance.‚ÄùTroxler‚Äôs department also found issues with Tractor Supply in Youngsville and with a Dollar General in Middleburg, a small community near Henderson. Each of those has also paid their fines.The Agriculture and Consumer Services Department does periodic inspections of price-scanner systems. These are not announced prior to arrival. Stores with more than a 2 percent error rate on overcharges are flagged, with inspectors discussing the findings with the store manager. A follow-up inspection takes place next.Penalties are only assessed when a store fails the follow-up inspection.The Family Dollar, as is protocol, was subject to inspection every 60 days until it met the 2 percent or less threshold.Anyone wishing to report a scanner error can call the Standards Division at 919-707-3225.Alan WootenBladen JournalAlan Wooten can be reached at 910-247-9132 or awooten@bladenjournal.com.
