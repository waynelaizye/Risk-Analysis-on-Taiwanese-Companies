It gives budget-focused 1080p gamers a better option against competing AMD cards in the same price bracket.A hulking, full-tower PC is always your best option if you want room for multiple graphics cards, general upgrades, or all the terabytes of storage you could ever reasonably afford. But these days, you don't necessarily need one if you want a powerful PC that can handle editing high-def or 4K video, playing new AAA games at 4K, and powering virtual-reality (VR) headsets.As more and more PC enthusiasts and boutique-PC builders have shown interest in compact performance systems, many case makers have offered up comparatively compact chassis that have room for midsize or even full-size graphics cards. For instance, the shoebox-shaped SilverStone Sugo SG12 has room enough for a graphics card over a foot long. That means the largest and most powerful cards available, such as the Nvidia GeForce GTX 2080 or AMD's Radeon VII, should have plenty of clearance in that case.The similarly compact Cougar QBX Ultra Compact Pro Gaming Mini-ITX Case has an even smaller footprint, and it has nearly 14 inches of clearance for beastly graphics cards. Just note that specialized compact cases like these usually require a MicroATX or Mini-ITX motherboard, rather than a more standard (and often less expensive) full-size ATX motherboard. Their unusual proportions mean that they may be able to take big video cards, but not big mainboards.It's possible to build a gaming-ready system even smaller, using a truly trim case such as the Cooler Master Elite 110 (which is just 11 by 10 by 11 inches). It can include an Intel Core i7-8700K or Core i7-9700K processor (the best chip you can reasonably use these days in a PC this small) and a powerful graphics card like the Zotac GeForce GTX 1650 Super Twin Fan or one based on the newer GeForce GTX 1660 or GTX 1660 Super. Those cards aren't extreme performers, but they do support VR gaming and can handle today's hardiest non-VR titles on high settings at 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) resolution.For graphics-card considerations specifically (which is likely why you landed here), the most important thing is how much card clearance the PC chassis that you own (or are considering buying) has available. This is often listed on the product page under \"specifications,\" or in an online manual. But in a pinch, you can pop off the side panel and do a rough estimate yourself, with a tape measure or ruler.\n*Deals are selected by our partner, TechBargains\nInside the case, find the area where the PCI Express card expansion brackets are, usually at the back. This is the spot where the video-output ports on a graphics card will show through the back of the chassis. Measure from there, parallel to the PCI Express slot into which you'll install your card, to the first obstruction you run across. That's your maximum card length, assuming your card does not have power connectors sticking out of its trailing end. If it does, you'll need to compensate for that. (Most of the time, these days, the connectors are on the top edge of the card.)If you want to fit a high-end gaming card, also be sure there's room for mounting the card across two expansion slots, because just about all such cards occupy at least two bracket positions across. Some very compact PC cases may not have very much space between the PCI Express slot you'll use for a card and the nearby case wall, which might prevent you from installing a card at all. If you're upgrading an existing system, at least an eyeball check is much advised.The distance between the bracket area and the nearest object on the other side of the case (often a hard drive mount or bay, or the wall of the case itself) will determine how long a graphics card your system can handle. If the case has 10.5 inches of clearance or more, you'll be able to fit most high-end cards, including most ultra-high-end cards based on, say, Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2070 or GeForce RTX 2080. It's likely that most AMD cards will be shorter than this length, as well, but always double-check before buying; there are always exceptions. The PowerColor Red Devil Radeon RX 570, for example, is a bit more than 11 inches long, despite not being all that powerful a card (compared to Nvidia's high-end offerings, anyway).For smaller PC cases that still have room for a full-height graphics card, you'll need an air-cooled card that may be 8 inches long or less. That may sound generously big enough, but as gaming-class graphics cards go, that's tiny. But even here these days, you have a few options on that front.Another factor to consider when building a compact PC is power supply (PSU) cable routing. While many cards on the market will keep their power-pin connection ports on top of the card (and equally as many compact or Mini-ITX cases are made to support this design), a few may opt to put the pin connector on the rear-facing edge of the card instead.If you're already working in a constrained space and every inch of the total card measurement matters, you'll want to be sure that wherever your card plugs into the PSU (if it does at all, more on that below) is accommodating to all the other parts and pieces you're trying to squeeze into a confined area.That said, many compact cards won't even ask you for a dedicated PSU power connection in the first place. Several options on this list, including the Zotac GeForce GTX 1650 OC and its PNY-made twin, don't need an external connection because they already pull all the watts they need from the PCI Express slot they're plugged into.Keep in mind that these cards have limitations on the amount of graphical horsepower and overclocking capacity they can support without an external power source. But if those aren't major concerns of yours, then you might want to go this route to avoid any cabling issues in the first place.You'll note that we've talked about card length, but not much about card height. A few thin PC cases (usually flat, broad ones meant for home-theater-PC use) accept only what are called \"low-profile\" expansion cards, among them low-profile PCI Express graphics cards. These cards are much shorter in the vertical dimension than an ordinary video card, and they can be outfitted with what's known as a low-profile or \"half-height\" bracket. (You twist a screw or two to install the shorter bracket in place of the ordinary one.) This enables the card to mount on the vertically smaller PCI-slot frame.There's usually room for just two ports on a half-height bracket, or in a few cards we've seen, the half-height bracket is two slots wide, allowing for a third port. So know that multi-display connectivity is often a bit compromised on these cards, especially with the low-profile bracket attached.Because low-profile boards are much smaller in surface area (and thus the room for a graphics chip, power circuitry, and cooling apparatus is reduced), they are budget-minded, basic cards, meant as a step up from CPU-integrated graphics or to add support for multiple displays. The brawniest low-profile card that we've seen for gamers of late is the last-gen GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GT LP from MSI.As always, size and features for video cards based on a given graphics chip can vary significantly, depending on the model and the card maker. Nvidia and AMD make \"reference cards\" based on their graphics processors. Third-party partners—MSI, Sapphire, EVGA, Asus, and many others—then make and sell their own branded cards, some of which adhere to the design of these reference boards. They also offer \"custom\" versions with slight differences in shape and size, the configuration of the ports, the amount and speed of onboard memory, and the cooling fans or heat sinks installed.Compact video cards fall into that custom class. Because of that, if you're shopping for a card for a compact system, or you have a particular case in mind, be sure the size, power, and cooling demands of the card you're buying match up with the chassis you're planning on putting it in. Few things in the gaming world are more frustrating than getting a promising new graphics card in the mail, or carting it home from the local superstore, only to find out it doesn't fit in your PC, or your power supply doesn't have the juice (or requisite connectors) to get it going.If you have a bit more room to play with in your PC case, check out our roundup of the best graphics cards for 4K gaming, which will be bigger cards.

    "https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/you-can-get-nvidias-rtx-voice-noise-filtering-without-a-pricey-rtx-card/": "Front page layoutSite themeSign up or login to join the discussions!\nKyle Orland\n    -  Apr 22, 2020 6:07 pm UTC\nFurther ReadingNvidia RTX 2080 and 2080 Ti review: A tale of two very expensive graphics cardsEarlier this month, Nvidia launched RTX Voice, a beta plugin that \"leverages NVIDIA RTX GPUs and their AI capabilities to remove distracting background noise from your broadcasts and voice chats,\" as Nvidia put it in its announcement. But despite the \"RTX\" branding, Ars testing confirms that the feature also works perfectly well on older GTX-level graphics cards. And despite that finding, Nvidia's installer refuses to allow the app on systems with non-RTX cards, unless the user performs some unintended config-file tinkering.First, the good news: Nvidia's GTX Voice technology actually works really well. As you can hear in the test sample below, turning on the feature filters out almost all of the mechanical keyboard clicking picked up by a standard webcam microphone. That's likely to be an especially useful feature for anyone who has tried typing notes during a Zoom video call or dealt with kids screaming in other rooms during the same.Now for the more questionable news: the \"RTX\" in \"RTX Voice\" seems to be a marketing misnomer. We know this only because of a workaround (seemingly first disclosed publicly by a Guru3D forum poster) that tricks the RTX Voice installer into working on a system with an older Nvidia graphics card. The process is as simple as running the installer, editing out a few lines from a temporary configuration file it creates, and then running the installer again without the \"constraint\" check active.Ars tested this method with an older gaming rig running a GTX 1060 video card. The successful results on that machine (which you can hear above) were indistinguishable from similar tests run on a more modern system with an RTX 2080.What's more, the Windows system monitor only topped out at about 3-percent usage while actively running the RTX Voice noise cancellation on a GTX 1060. That suggests the older CUDA cores on the 1060 (and other older Nvidia cards) are more than enough to handle this feature and that the more advanced tensor cores in the RTX lineup aren't absolutely necessary for \"RTX Voice.\"It's possible that older Nvidia GPUs may suffer more when running RTX Voice while the GPU is under heavy load from other video processing work. While the low GPU usage numbers in our test suggest any such impact won't be significant, we haven't performed comprehensive testing to substantiate this.That said, it seems odd to completely bar non-RTX users from even trying out the beta on their systems (perhaps with an install-time warning) in order to judge the potential performance impact on their own. Over at Guru3D, users are reporting success running RTX Voice on Nvidia's 10XX and 16XX series cards, with more mixed results on the 9XX-series.Nvidia was not able to respond to a request for comment as of press time (and we'll be sure to update if and when they do). But the company's announcement earlier this month suggested that the beta feature had been rolled out earlier than expected.\"Like many of you, we're all trying to adjust to our new normal. Our homes are now a shared office, streaming studio, and gaming den all in one,\" staffer \"Tim@Nvidia\" wrote. \"We've been silently working away on RTX Voice —our noise-cancelling app—but wanted to get this in your hands as soon as possible via an early-access community beta. The product is still in development, but we hope you find it useful!\"Development beta or not, for now it appears that limiting RTX Voice only to Nvidia's priciest graphics cards is a move that's being driven more by marketing than by any technical concerns. But Nvidia could still patch out this workaround at any moment, so if you want to RTX Voice on a GTX card, download the current beta build (V 0.5.12.6) as soon as you can.You must login or create an account to comment.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.\n  CNMN Collection\n  WIRED Media Group\n  © 2020 Condé Nast.

    "https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/rumor-nvidias-geforce-rtx-3000-video-cards-launch-delayed-to-september.html": "With all that is going on in the world, it seems that NVIDIA is adapting as well. The Ampera GPU based consumer products would now be announced in September. Originally is was the plan to share detail on the new architecture during the postponed GDC. With Computex postponed, and (for now) scheduled and moved towards September Nvidia would join up to announce Ampere. It would already be an introduction to that, as it had previously done with Turing. According to the source (tweak town), the company would first launch a business Quadro video card, with the RTX 3000 series for gamers and consumers shortly following later in the year. For the time being, however, this is bigtime speculation. ",
    "https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-radeon-gpu-steal-data-radio-transmission-cybersecurity": "\nBy\nPaul Alcorn\n23 April 2020\nWhat's the frequency, Kenneth? In a reminder that no computing device is truly safe from prying eyes, a researcher at security firm Duo recently used an AMD Radeon Pro WX 3100 video card as a radio transmitter to transmit data, all without physically modifying the hardware. This allowed him to receive the data through a wall 50 feet away, thus stealing data from an air-gapped PC. The researcher accomplished the feat by manipulating the graphics card's shader clock rates to become a tunable radio device. The fundamental concept behind any side-channel attack is simple; an attacker steals data by manipulating and then observing external indicators, like blinking lights or fan vibrations on your PC. The most nefarious aspect of these attacks is that the hardware actually works as designed, so the slight modifications aren't detectable by anti-virus scanners. In this case, the attackers used the radio frequencies generated by the GPU as it operated at different clock rates. For the receiving device, the researchers used a Software Defined Radio (SDR) device that plugs into a standard USB port. You can pick up one of these receivers for less than $100, but the researcher employed a more sensitive and expensive model that typically retails between $300 and $600. With that tool in hand, the researcher paired it with both a UHF and a directional ultra-wideband antenna to assemble the capture device and then employed open source software to run the receiver.We turned a Radeon GPU's shader clock in to a tunable radio transmitter that can jump through walls & get picked up 50ft away.Get your Van Eck fill and learn how to find these and other RF side-channels from myself and @baron of @duo_labs! https://t.co/nTsEpSqahL pic.twitter.com/ElfA0Q8eqIApril 22, 2020The compromised test subject consisted of a Dell Precision 3430 workstation, notably without a wireless chipset, and a Radeon Pro WX 3100 graphics card. Using the Linux operating system, the researcher accessed the standard power controls for the Radeon Pro card and experimented first by switching between two shader clock frequencies (734 MHz and 214 MHz). That change shifted power around, which then generated a 428 MHz signal that the researchers picked up with the receiving device from 50 feet away–and through a wall. This simple method of encoding the data with a rudimentary on/off signal would prove too slow for meaningful attacks, as data transmission is limited to passing one bit of data per clock adjustment. The researchers then shifted between five different 1MHz clock increments to enable better encoding and, therefore, faster radio transmission of data. With the GPU transmitting data over detectable radio waves, all that's left is to create a coded way of passing data from the GPU to the receiver, thus stealing info from the host computer even if it isn't connected to the internet. The researcher didn't share the achieved data rates but contended that he could enhance the technique further to enable even more rapid data transmissions.There are limitations to the technique, as it would require a machine compromised by another attack (like malware) to set up the correct code. Still, it displays just how one could leverage seemingly innocuous aspects of our computers, like clock frequencies, to transmit data from seemingly secure systems. Building the receiver and detecting the transmission is seemingly relatively simple, but developing an enhanced encoding technique to pass data at a faster rate and compromising the target machine would require a tremendous amount of technical acumen. That means we shouldn't expect beginners or script kiddies to pull off these types of attacks, and the knowledge and sophistication needed to exploit this type of attack probably relegate it to nation-states engaging in espionage, like when the U.S. compromised the Iranian nuclear production facilities with Stuxnet. Given the method of attack, it's possible that similar exploits could be developed for Nvidia GPUs and possibly even from CPUs and other clock-driven devices. But unless you have nuclear launch codes stored on your system, you're probably safe. Then again, the code behind Stuxnet eventually leaked and was used by others, so paranoid types might look into some extra electromagnetic shielding for their gaming rigs.  Get instant access to breaking news, in-depth reviews and helpful tips.Tom's Hardware is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

    "https://phonemantra.com/asus-geforce-gtx-1650-gddr6-phoenix-graphics-card-cooling-design-includes-one-80mm-fan/": "ASUS introduced the Asus GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 Phoenix graphics card (catalogue number – PH-GTX1650-O4GD6). This card occupies two slots in the PC case, but the small length and height make it quite suitable for small PCs. The card is 174 mm long and 126 mm high.The design of the cooling system of the Asus GeForce GTX 1650 GDDR6 Phoenix video card includes a monolithic aluminium heatsink and one 80 mm Axial-Tech fan. These fans, which are found in some higher-class Asus cards, use double ball bearings and impellers with blades, the ends of which are closed in a ring, due to which the entire airflow is directed along the fan axis, without scattering to the sides.The Turing 12U TU117 GPU configuration, which serves as the base of the card, includes 896 CUDA cores, 56 texture units and 32 raster units. The width of the memory bus is 128 bits. The graphics processor is slightly overclocked – from 1590 MHz to 1605 MHz, and 4 GB of memory work at a recommended speed of 12 Gb / s. No additional power connectors. The output list includes one DVI-D DL, HDMI 2.0b, and DisplayPort 1.4a.The manufacturer did not name the price of the novelty, but the source suggests that it will be close to 160 dollars.Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. \n\n\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n",
