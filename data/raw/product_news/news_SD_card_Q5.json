Here’s how you can do that.The Switch has long lacked — and desperately needed — the ability to transfer data from the console’s system to the microSD cards most Switch owners use. Before now, the only way to “move” your game data would be to completely redownload it. Given how many games are currently on the Switch, it makes sense that you’d rather have the bulk of them be on the card. If you have enough room on your system memory, you could also in theory use it to transfer games from one SD card to another using the Switch’s system as an intermediary.Read: Here are 7 essential games to get you started on Nintendo SwitchNintendo does warn in the update notes that, while “downloadable software, update data, and DLC” can be transferred back and forth, “save data and some update data cannot be transferred to an SD card.”So if you want to transfer your game data to your SD card, how do you do it? Here’s a quick guide. (Side note: the fact that the Switch doesn’t support screenshots within its settings is a continued thorn in my side, but hopefully these pictures will suffice.)First, this should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway: make sure you have the latest system update. Once you’ve done that, go to your Settings (represented by a gear, natch) on your Switch menu and find the Data Management tab. You’ll find the new option, “Move Data Between System/microSD Card.” Yeah, they’ve made it that simple.Once you’ve selected that option, the Switch will show you two options: one for moving data to the SD card, and one for moving it to the system memory. They work the exact same way, so we’ll do a transfer to the SD card for demonstration purposes.The Switch will show you which games are available to transfer — the list will include every game on your console, but the ones already on the destination will be greyed out. You can select as many games as you’d like to transfer, and it’ll show you how much space it’ll free up in the display. We’ll use Bayonetta as an example. It’s the only game I currently have installed on my system memory, and as this screenshot shows, it’s taking up quite a lot of space. So might as well kill two birds with a stone and transfer it to my SD card.Once you’ve selected all the games you want to transfer, select “Move Data.” You’ll be prompted to confirm the move, and the transfer will begin.Oh, and be warned that, depending on the size of the game, this could take you a while. Bayonetta took five minutes to transfer completely one-way, though it was a pretty massive game, as stated. You’ll see a progress bar pop up showing you how much of the game is left to transfer.And that’s it! Now you can move your Switch games around to your heart’s content.

Included are two big changes that console owners have been requesting for some time. Update 10.0.0 is available for download to Nintendo Switch consoles. The system update allows players to remap the buttons and switch the analog sticks on the Joy-Cons, the Pro Controller and the Switch Lite. Up to five configurations can be saved internally on the Switch. Another change is the option to transfer downloadable software and update data from the SD card to the Switch's internal memory. What can't be moved over is saved game data and certain update files. Aside from these two features, the 10.0.0 update lets users bookmark news items, adds more profile icons and a new Play Activity setting.

    "https://www.fierceelectronics.com/electronics/firmware-tweak-converts-security-cam-into-webcam": "Over the past month, millions of people have been sent home to work, many scrambling to upgrade or augment their personal computer equipment. Webcams, which are essential to Zoom and other online collaboration tools, have been snapped up as fast as face masks.No kidding. According to the NPD Group’s Weekly Retail Tracking Service, retailers saw a  226% increase in sales of USB cameras in the five weeks ending April 4, 2020. With inventories picked clean, third-party retailers, grifters really, are pouncing on the opportunity with ridiculous pricing in some cases, as first reported by The VergeRight now, for example, on Amazon you can buy a Logitech HD webcam C270 desktop--used, mind you--for $99.00. The camera’s normal retail price is $24.99.Companies like Logitech are said to be amping up their production, but apparently not quickly enough. To wit, a colleague of my husband’s, who teaches at MIT, recently walked into a local MicroCenter here in Cambridge, MA, looking to buy a webcam.Disappointed to find the shelves for webcams stripped bare, he was heading to the checkout line when he saw a bin of Wyze Cam v2 home security cameras for sale, with a microSD card bundled with each camera. Designed for home security applications, this compact camera comes with features like motion tracking, two-way audio, free cloud storage, and a microSD Card slot for storing video locally.Interest piqued, he took a closer look and realized that included with the bundle were instructions for converting the Cam v2 into a webcam through a firmware update with an SD card. There are instructions for downloading the firmware on the Wyze website.Aware of the growing shortage of webcams, engineers at Wyze figured out a simple firmware update to convert the Cam v2 into a fully-functional webcam. On its website support page, Wyze states that “This solution is only for folks who need a need webcam but can’t buy one and it should be used ‘as is’.” It has no plans to provide improvements or bug fixes.The firmware update been tested and the camera works on Mac OS 10.13, Windows 7 and 10, but Wyze says it may not be compatible with all computer operating systems. It also works with Zoom, GoToMeeting, Blue Jeans, Google Hangouts, Skype and Cisco.The only performance issued noted is that the mic audio may be low.At $19.99, it’s an affordable option if you need a webcam. And if at some point you're heading back to work and no longer have a use for a webcam, you can convert the Wyze Cam back into its intended purpose.RELATED: 2 MP image sensor meets entry-level camera needsCloud service provider revenue great 53% on indispensable video servicesBloomberg quotes unnamed sources saying the first Apple processors will be in Macs next yearCOVID-19 caused increase in online activities and demand for IT products in first quarter, according to memory giant SK Hynix\n© 2020 Questex LLC.

    "https://phandroid.com/2020/04/23/how-to-supercharge-any-laptop-with-an-ssd/": "So here we are 2020 and the world is crumbling beneath us. Now more than ever we are relying on our laptops and home computers when we are sent packing to work from home. Not a new concept but with to date over 1 billion people already being asked to self-isolate there are going to be some really frustrated home computer and laptop users out there. Here is how you can supercharge the speed of your aging laptop with an SSD for as little as €30 ($35).It was only recently that I took my 2012 Samsung Series 7 Chronos to Berlin for IFA’19 – Well, that was my intention. At the airport i dropped my bag and rendered the chunky 8 year old beast useless. The old slow HDD had bitten the dust.. My heart sank, luckily I always keep an instant backup with Google’s Backup & Sync so not all was lost. Fast-forward 5 months and I found myself with a colossal 3kg silver Samsung coaster, so I splurged on a 1TB SanDisk SSD Plus. Instantly, it was like a new laptop. No more lag and the Windows boot speed went from zero to hero.During my time of post-mortem Samsung laptop depression I bit the bullet and bought a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon my first big “for work” purchase in years. I clearly didn;t know what I was missing and charging on USB-C is a life changer. While choosing specs I settled for less storage, with the foresight of upgrading later. Internal storage media choice is down to personal preference, but when i need new storage media I always head straight for SanDisk or Western Digital for one simple reason, I’ve never had a bad experience. So I thought it would be a great idea to showcase the various storage media available that I trust to improve your laptop or desktop PC’s storage and speed at various price points.There are many ways that you might want to increase the storage of your laptop or desktop PC maybe a removable SD or MicroSD card is enough with sizes ranging from 32GB to 1TB or you might be looking for something a tad more robust, an Internal SSD is perfect in this situation. Over the past year or two i have been upgrading all my storage media to SSD with a secondary copy on Google’s free cloud backup. I just wish I had done it all sooner, there was always one thing standing in my way. Price.SSD drives have never been more affordable with prices starting at just €30 for 120GB and they are available from a variety of different brands and in various storage capacities however for the nature of this article I’ll be listing the drives i know i can recommend from personal experience. Namely Sandisk and WD Black from Western Digital. My go to laptop SSD replacement is the SanDisk SSD PLUS 480GB. It costs on average about €60 and I’ve refreshed many laptops for clients and family in recent times with one of these. They range in capacity from 120GB to 2TB so plenty opportunity to pick a size that suits your needs. My mom is currently rocking a 120GB SSD Plus in her seven year old Dell. It cost me around 30 euro on Amazon and to her it feels like a brand new machine.Since buying the Lenovo Thinkpad i began looking for something to beef up the internal storage, i originally had a 480GB m.2 drive but since starting to edit video more often I needed something a bit bigger to cope with the file sizes, enter the WD_Black SN750 2TB to take its place. There’s something really magical about SSD, no noise or spinning up. Not to mention the boot up times you’ll experience will now be in the seconds rather than the minutes. I had time to make a cup of tea while I waited for my old samsung to spring to life. Really if it’s something you’ve been considering for a while you should absolutely do it.Next up I’ll adding a 1TB Sandisk Extreme micro SD card to my Thinkpad to store all my cloud drive data from Google Drive and Dropbox. At the moment i have the 400GB Sandisk Extreme in there however I find that I’m having to use selective sync more often with Dropbox because the micro SD has a smaller capacity than my online storage. “First World Problems” i hear you cry, but it doesn’t hurt to make your life easier, right?If you have noticed that your laptop has slowed down since you bought it, it honestly could be something as simple as upgrading the old hard drive to an SSD. Nine times out of ten you will breathe new life into the old slug and wonder why you hadn’t already made the switch. Swapping out a laptop hard drive isn’t difficult at all but you will need to install a fresh version of your chosen operating system. So, if you’d like to start with a fresh installation of windows 10 check out this article for where to find affordable Microsoft Windows and Office software licenses.Prices will vary between regions and availability will differ. All prices included in this article are based on finding the product on Amazon, but you might find better deals elsewhere. Here are the prices in Europe (April 2020)Sandisk SSD Plus €30 – €270\nSandisk Extreme Micro SD €14 – €575\nWD Black SN750 m.2 SSD €80 – €425\n—This isn’t a paid article i just really enjoy using Sandisk & Western Digital products.
