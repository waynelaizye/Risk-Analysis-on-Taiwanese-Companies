That said, what if you could? It's becoming easier and easier to replicate that class of projection at home, especially if you've got a wall or projector screen big enough to use.That means you could turn your movie nights from small-screen situations to main events, and upgrade your home into a rival to your local multiplex. Of course, you'll need a projector for the job - preferably a future-proof model that can project at 4K resolution. We've taken a deep dive into the market to find you the best candidates for your home projection needs. squirrel_widget_231768The key to Optoma's success with this projector is its price - you simply won't find 4K imaging this cheaply and with such quality reproduction anywhere else. In fact, as you'll see, you could pay multiples of its price from other manufacturers. The UHD40 is a cracking projector with solid brightness and great colour, plus pinpoint detail. If you're looking for a 4K projector and don't have thousands to spend it's a superb pick, although it lacks some of the portability and ease of use that others manage. squirrel_widget_189129This sleek projector from Epson might be a good chunk more expensive than the Optoma in top spot, but it's still a good price when you survey the market more widely, given that you're getting really good 4K video with HDR, and a really impressive contrast ratio. It uses pixel shifting to upscale to 4K, meaning that it can't quite match the detail of more expensive models (like the Sony that's up next), but it's still a great option for most people's needs. It's really easy to use and adjust, too, which is an absolute must for home projection, and its remote is a dream. squirrel_widget_189134With native 4K and even 3D capabilities, Sony's hugely expensive beast of a projector will have you feeling like a professional cinema owner before long. It offers a simply stunning picture, bright and sharp, and is one of the best ways to watch any video content at home.That said, it's also ferociously expensive, and surely outside of most people's budgets. If you've got the money, though, and want to view movies at home in stunning quality blown up massively, there's not much that can compete with Sony's picture. squirrel_widget_231807LG's idea with the CineBeam is to make an all-in-one portable projector that can do it all, and it's managed a really impressive feat along those lines. Simply place the tower where you want it to project, power it up and you're away. It's genuinely portable and easy to use, with really solid picture quality to go with it.That convenience means it's pretty expensive, though, and you aren't exactly getting cinema quality sound from it, either, but we really like how it can seamlessly fit into your home, easily storing away when you're not using it and coming out for movie nights. squirrel_widget_189124With extremely impressive 4K upscaling and HDR on board, this is a great option from BenQ if your top priority is the brightness of the picture - something that can take a little getting used to when you switch to projection from a TV. It cranks out fully 3,000 lumens to make for a super-bright picture, freeing you up to worry a bit less about dimming your room right down.That's a nice bonus, but you also get really solid picture quality - although that brightness does have a trade-off when it comes to shadow depth and blacks. Still, it's a great projector at its price. ",

Plus when it’s not in use, it’s not taking up a large chunk of your living room either.To get the best out of them, projectors do need a bit of a helping hand. That means the darker you can get your room, the better, and a dedicated projector screen (rather than a wall) will ensure you get the very best picture possible. Our pick of the best includes portable and short throw projectors for those with less space than traditional projectors require, as well as options for gamers, those on more of a budget and those with money to blow. \nBy\nWIRED\nWhen it comes to buying a projector, forget everything you might have learned from buying a TV. The considerations are almost entirely different, unless your budget is limitless.Yes, the very best native 4K projectors will deliver the very best picture, but they’ll also empty your bank account – expect price tags to start around £5,000 but jump to around £20,000 for some. Thankfully, all but the most discerning cinephiles will probably find their big-screen needs met at a price a lot lower than that. That’s thanks to the growing number of “faux-K” projectors that use clever pixel shifting technology to reproduce a 4K picture so well, you might not even realise the difference.For that reason, we’ve chosen the Epson EH-TW9400 (£2,548) as our overall winner for best projector. It’s not native 4K, but we reckon you’d never know without a direct comparison. The picture is outstanding, the setup is easy and it offers good specs for the price. Try and find a better projector under £5,000, we dare you.View the Epson EH-TW9400 for £2,548 on Audio Affair \nBy\nWIRED\nFor those on a stricter budget, we’ve picked the BenQ W2700 (£1,400) for its superb value. It's our best affordable projector right now. View the BenQ W2700 for £1,400 on Amazon Meanwhile LG’s CineBeam HU80KSW (£1,999) is a convenient choice for those who’d rather not keep a projector out all the time. It's the best projector for convenience on test. View the LG CineBeam HU80KSW for £1,999 on Amazon WIRED Recommends is your definitive guide to the best things to buy.

That means you’ll struggle to find a picture better than this for less than about £5,000.\nBy\nWIRED\nBefore you buy it though, you’re going to want to make sure you’ve got the space for it, as it’s a pretty chunky bit of kit. At 11kg, it’s probably best suited to a dedicated rack or ceiling mount, but it can shift its image vertically and horizontally to accommodate a less-than-ideal placement if necessary. You’ll just need a minimum throw (the distance between where the projector is and what it’s projecting on to) of 1.5m.The EH-TW9400’s 2.1x optical zoom lens means it can produce an image from 50in up to 300in, and with a bright 2,600 lumens to play with, it’ll even play ball in a lighter room. Intuitive menus and handy motorised lens controls (unusual at this price) mean it’s pretty easy to setup too, which isn’t always the case with projectors, and a definite plus for the EH-TW9400.As mentioned, this projector doesn’t have a native 4K chip, but that doesn’t affect its ability to produce a lushly detailed 4K resolution picture, with HDR to boot. HDR is not a technology that’s easy for projectors to handle, but the EH-TW9400 gives it a good go, and delivers bright, vibrant HDR images that are among the best we’ve seen at this level.Colours are bold but accurate, blacks are deep and detailed and highlights stand out with impressive brightness. HDR images definitely have added punch, but SDR images still look bright, insightful and natural, and even upscaled images look fantastic too. No matter what you throw at this projector, it offers an exceptional performance for the money.\nBy\nWIRED\nOur only niggles? It’s a little noisy when working at its hardest and there’s the occasional motion hiccup with the fastest of movement, but neither impact the overall experience enough to make us love this projector any less.  Pros: Outstanding picture across the board; great colour handling; easy to setup; good spec for the moneyCons: A little noisy; occasional motion hiccupsPrice: £2,548 |  Check price on Audio Affair | Sevenoaks | Richer Sounds A superb value projector that can’t be beaten at its price\nBy\nWIRED\nPicture: 4K HDR | Brightness: 2000 lumens | Inputs: 2 x HDMI, 1 x USB | Ethernet: Yes | Lamp life: Up to 15,000 hours | Zoom: 1.3x | Projection ratio: 1.13 – 1.47:1 | Screen size: 40 – 200 inches  | Throw distance: 1.15m to 5.76m | Dynamic contrast ratio: 30,000:1 | Built-in speakers: Yes | Dimensions (hwd): 38 x 13 x 26cm | Weight: 4.2kgThere are few projectors under £2,000 that can match up the BenQ W2700. What you get for your money here is excellent, even if it does come with some expected budget-based compromises.Let’s start with the good stuff though, because there’s plenty of it. The W2700 (£1,400) is a 4K DLP projector that offers 2,000 lumens of brightness at its best. It packs a wide colour filter that helps the projector hit 95% of the DCI-P3 colour space and is capable of pictures up to 120 inches.Its pretty compact too, meaning it can be accommodated by most living room set ups – though you’ll need a minimum throw of at least three metres to get the very biggest picture.Of course, at this price, this isn’t native 4K, but the picture its capable of is every bit as sharp and insightful as you’d want it to be.\nBy\nWIRED\nHDR images are rich and detailed, with a vibrant colour palette that is naturally handled. The wide colour filter does knock a fair bit of brightness off the picture though, so if your room isn’t that dark, you might prefer to take the hit on colour and turn this off to bring a bit more light to proceedings.If you can keep it on though, we’d recommend it – black levels are much better with it on and it just gives HDR images just a bit more life compared with SDR.Speaking of black levels, they are never going to be a strong point on an affordable DLP projector, and even at their best, the blacks here still verge on the side of grey. It does better than a lot of the competition at this level though, and still manages to retrieve a good amount of shadow detail before it’s lost in the darkest of scenes.Elsewhere, we recommend keeping motion processing off for the best performance – it’s not really needed and causes more issues than it solves when switched on. Also the built-in 5W stereo speakers do a fine job for the short-term but you’re going to want to upgrade them if you want an audio performance as good as the picture.Pros: Crisp, detailed 4K picture; good HDR for the price; great value performance; decent motion handlingCons: Blacks could be deeper; dull picture with HDR won’t suit all environments\nBy\nWIRED\nPrice: £1,400 | Check price on Amazon | Scan | Richer SoundsA native 4K projector for those with serious money to spendPicture: 4K HDR (native) | Brightness: 1800 lumens | Inputs: 2 x HDMI 2.0 | Ethernet: Yes | Lamp life: Up to 4,500 hours | Zoom: 2.0x | Projection ratio: 1.43 - 2.94:1 | Screen size: Not listed | Throw distance: Not listed | Dynamic contrast ratio: 400,000:1 | Built-in speakers: No | Dimensions (hwd): 23.4 x 50 x 49.5cm | Weight: 19.6kgThe price tag on the JVC DLA-N5 (£6,495) might scream flagship, but in fact, it is the entry-level model for JVC’s native 4K projector range. Even so, we reckon the balance of what it offers for the money might just make it the pick of the bunch.\nBy\nWIRED\nThis is a native 4K projector with a brightness of 1800 lumens and high native contrast of 40,000:1. It supports HDR10 and HLG (Hybrid Log Gamma, for broadcast), and offers dynamic tone mapping to improve HDR performance. This means it balances out the image’s darkest and lightest points for the best performance, without making the picture dull.As you’d expect at this sort of price, there are full calibration controls if you’d like to go professional on the set up, but there is also an auto calibration feature for ease too.The slightly lower lumen level compared with its pricier siblings means that this projector really will be at its best in a very dark room, and it’ll be in this environment that you’ll see what the N5 is really capable of.At its best, the picture is nothing short of cinematic, with sharp detail, rich colours and an amazing level of texture and insight – even skin tones are handled with level of accuracy that’s hard to achieve. While the pricier N7 does just pip the N5 for punch thanks to its added Wide Colour Gamut filter, you won’t find anything about this picture dull.  In fact, the N5 produces some of the best HDR images you’ll experience from a projector at this price. The dynamic tone mapping at play here does a great job of creating a natural but effective HDR performance that keeps the image bright and far outclasses the competition. \nBy\nWIRED\nBlacks are as inky deep as you’ll find anywhere at this level, shadow detail is fantastic and highlights sit brightly alongside them. SDR images are handled with a similar level of care, and even the fastest motion can’t shake the video processing at play here.It’s one of the best all-round performances we’ve ever seen from a projector, and aside from spending a lot more money to get arguably minor improvements, there’s very little to find fault in here. A big price tag perhaps, but it delivers a suitably big performance.Pros: Excellent picture quality; dynamic tone mapping for brilliant HDR; outstanding black levels; good motion processingCons: If pressed? Colours could have a touch more punchPrice: £6,495 | Check price on Sevenoaks | Audio Affair A projector built around conveniencePicture: 4K HDR | Brightness: 2500 lumens | Inputs: 2 x HDMI 2.0, 2 x USB | Ethernet: Yes | Laser life: Up to 20,000 hours | Zoom: 1.2x | Projection ratio: 1.43 - 2.94:1 | Screen size: 40 – 150 inches | Throw distance: 1.15m to 4.3m | Dynamic contrast ratio: 150,000:1 | Built-in speakers: Yes | Dimensions (hwd): 47 x 16.5 x 16.5cm | Weight: 6.7kgThe LG CineBeam HU80KSW (£1,999) is something of a unique proposition - a sort of high-end home cinema in-a-box, that offers a projector, sound system and source in one reasonably compact and portable package. You don’t even need a stand or mount, thanks to its standalone tower-like design (though you can mount it from the ceiling if you prefer).Versatility is the name of the game here. With an impressive 2,500 lumens, it doesn’t need a pitch-black home cinema room to get the best out of it, plus its design means it can be shoved away in a cupboard when not in use, and brought out when you need it. You can stand it up to project onto a wall, or lie it down and project onto the ceiling. Thankfully the Auto Vertical Keystone will help you get the image aligned without much fuss, and you can zoom and focus manually for images between 66 and 150 inches.The built-in sound system is made up of 7W per channel stereo speakers tuned by Harman Kardon, which are actually pretty good, if lacking a bit of bass. Thankfully there is also Bluetooth built-in, which means you can add to the sound by pairing it with a wireless speaker or soundbar, or use the aux output instead.Two HDMIs and two USBs cover physical sources but with built-in smart apps including Netflix, plus the ability to mirror content from a smartphone using Miracast, this really is a plug-and-play device.It carries on ticking boxes with its performance too, offering a crisp, nuanced 4K picture that’s bright and filled with detail. Colours are subtle rather than punchy, but they never look washed out – just well balanced. Black levels could be a little deeper and motion a touch smoother, but they’re far from deal-breakers in a all-round package as good as this.Pros: Innovative, one-box system; sharp 4K picture; versatile; bright imageCons: Not the last word in black level; motion could be better; built-in speakers lack bassPrice: £1,999 | Check price on Amazon | Richer SoundsA portable projector so you can take movie night with youPicture: 720p HD | Brightness: 300 lumens | Inputs: 1 x HDMI 1.4 , 1 x USB | Ethernet: No | Lamp life: Up to 30,000 hours | Zoom: None | Projection ratio: 1.2:1 | Screen size: 30 – 150 inches | Throw distance: 0.8m to 4m | Dynamic contrast ratio: 1,000:1 | Built-in speakers: Yes | Dimensions (hwd): 14 x 12 x 18cm | Weight: 1.5kgWhile the rest of the projectors featured in this round up are aimed at a more serious home-cinema enthusiast, the Anker Nebula Mars II (£600) is more suited for the casual viewer, who’s prepared to trade in a bit of performance for convenience.It’s a portable projector – not as small as its stablemate, the Nebula Capsule II, but still small enough to move around as you need, and has a carry handle for easy pick-up-and-go.It’s designed to be a bit of a one-box wonder, and a lot of its appeal is that it requires nothing else to get started. It features Wi-Fi, has access to apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime and BBC iPlayer, and has a built-in battery for up to four hours of runtime away from a plug. It even has its own speaker for sound, and though it’s pretty light on bass, it doesn’t do a bad job at all.It’s really easy to use too, with next-to-no setup faff. Automatic focusing and keystone correction means it’s as simple as pointing it at a wall and letting the picture do the rest, while the Android-based interface is simple to navigate as well.The Mars II is capable of a 720p HD picture and can project a picture up to 100 inches, though you’ll probably get the very best picture a little smaller than that. Its light output is a pretty measly 300 lumens though, so you’re going to need a very dark room to get the best out of it.Even under the best conditions, colours are arguably only just so-so, and sharpness leaves a bit to be desired too – even when you remember it’s only a 720p image at play.These compromises in picture quality might well be a deal breaker in a different projector, but in the Nebula Mars II, they feel like an acceptable trade-off for the convenience, ease of use and – above all – fun you get in return.Home cinema enthusiasts will almost certainly want to look elsewhere, but there’s a lot to love about the balance of considerations the Nebula Mars II makes. For casual users looking for a plug-and-play home cinema in-a-box, this is a whole lot of fun indeed.Pros: Easy to use; simple to set up; convenient all-in-one design; good picture quality in a dark room; decent audio for casual useCons: Colours are so-so; not bright enough for daytime usePrice: £600 | Check price on Amazon | Anker A great projector for gamingPicture: 1080p HD | Brightness: 3400 lumens | Inputs: 2 x HDMI, 1 x USB | Ethernet: No | Lamp life: Up to 10,000 hours | Zoom: 1.1x | Projection ratio: 1.47 – 1.62:1 | Screen size: 28 – 301 inches  | Throw distance: 1m to 9.8m | Dynamic contrast ratio: 50,000:1 | Built-in speakers: Yes | Dimensions (hwd): 32 x 11 x 24cm | Weight: 2.9kgWhen you’re buying a projector primarily for gaming, the checklist is a little different to buying one for films. The Optoma HD29H (£700) ticks a large number of those boxes, not least of all with its outstanding 8.4ms latency for super-fast response times.At 2.5kg, it’s also nice and light, so you can move it around in your house, or even take it with you to a mate’s house, if you’re feeling particularly dedicated to the cinematic gaming cause. The trade-off is that, while the rounded edges and glossy white finish are nice, it feels a little lightweight and plastic-y. The Optoma offers an impressive amount of brightness, with a claimed 3,400 lumens meaning you'll be able to play games in a room with ambient light without issue. There’s even a built-in 10W speaker, though it does start to grate at high volume.At this price, it isn’t 4K, but it does offer 1080p HDR gaming at 120Hz, and can downscale 4K sources too. To get the very best 8ms lag time as quoted though, you’ll have to play in HD SDR using the Enhanced Game Mode.That might seem a bit of a shame considering the capabilities of today’s consoles, but when the SDR images are as clean, bright and crisp as they are here, it’s actually not a bad trade off at all. You can still make the most of its HDR capabilities with movies, as the HD29H performs well here too. The brightness that the HD29H serves up really helps with delivering a pretty convincing HDR effect that is unusual to find at this price.Black levels are good, and only very high-contrast scenes struggle with greyer shadowy areas. Detail retrieval is strong in all but the darkest of scenes and motion handling is pretty solid as well – even during high-paced gaming.Colours miss out on a bit of oomph that comes from the wide colour filters on pricier projectors, but that doesn’t stop the HD29H delivering a natural, nuanced colour palette that works well with most content.Great for gaming, then, but actually pretty handy with movies too – all at a good price. If you can forgo 4K, or your budget determines you have to, the HD29H offers a lot to love.Pros: Good value; sharp, detailed picture; HDR content performs surprisingly well; low input lagCons: Colours could have more punch; lowest input lag limited to HD SDR gamingPrice: £700 | Check price on Amazon | Scan | Richer Sounds \n                        Get The Email from WIRED, your no-nonsense briefing on all the biggest stories in technology, business and science.

    "https://www.techgenyz.com/2020/04/24/medico-designs-face-shield-from-overhead-projector-sheets/": "When the coronavirus pandemic hit Mumbai and medical workers appeared clueless on how to treat patients by ensuring their own safety, an enterprising female medical practitioner found a solution by designing a face shield made out of overhead projector sheets.The medical practitioner, working as an infection control expert at a suburban hospital, said a face shield should be made of plastic to stop fluid from entering inside.\"Hence, I decided to use A4transparency sheets of overhead projectors and made face shields. They are washable and can be reused. I gave these face fields to hospital staff till PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) supplies came,\" she told PTI.After testing the in-house produced shields for factors like comfort and clarity among others, the prototype was approved and 1,000 units were made, she said.The shields have helped address the shortage of safety equipment for medical workers who are at the forefront of fighting the battle against coronavirus.\"Once a person wears personal protective equipment (PPE), he feels safe. But they don't realize that you have to handle the PPE properly or else it will become a potential source of infection,\" she said.It was difficult to explain to health workers about the product initially when the hospital started admitting suspected COVID-19 patients in its isolation ward, she said.Health workers were in a panic mode since there were no guidelines on treating such patients, said the medical professional.\"Hospitals never felt the need to stock PPEs till the coronavirus came knocking at our doors,\" she said.\"Protecting eyes, mouth, and nose is very important as they facilitate entry of the virus into the body,\" he said.\"There is a sequence/procedure to use or remove the PPE. You have to ensure you don't contaminate or infect yourself,\" said the doctor, who is in charge of handling infection control protocols at the hospital.She was given the task of putting safety protocol in place for the judicious use of PPEs by medical workers and managing supply and to prevent their overuse or misuse.\"The biggest challenge was to find a solution to the shortage of PPEs. Due to rising fear among medical workers, PPE kits were used extensively, leading to their shortage,\" she said.She has now trained over 300 workers in infection prevention and control, disposal of biomedical waste, and appropriate use of PPE.\"PPE is required when if you are doing any procedure on a patient within one-meter distance. When you are spending 15 minutes with the patient within one meter.\"PPE is compulsory for procedures like suction, intubation, extubation, nebulization, throat or nasal swab collection, ENT or ophthalmic examination, dental procedure,\" she said.\"While checking pulse or putting IV line gloves and face shields are enough. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has provided guidelines for rational use of PPEs for all such things,\" she said.\"Ours is not a COVID-19 hospital. We have an isolation ward. Many health workers are not reporting for work but those who are, are facing different challenges,\" she said.\"The government is providing support to health workers but you need to listen to them more.Till swab report of a patient comes, there is apprehension whether we will be quarantined.\"Some hospitals are allowing them to work for 14 days and then rest for 14 days. Each hospital takes its own decision,\" she said.She said drawing up safety protocols is a challenging task as she has to take into account standards laid down by the WHO and the central government.Loading....",

Home theater projectors are an increasingly attractive alternative due to their ability to render a broad range of image sizes. With that in mind, projectors are a perfect solution for buyers who want a truly big screen experience in their home.I've relied on projectors for watching movies and shows for five years now, and the Epson Home Cinema 3800 4K 3LCD Projector is the best I've used. The projector's image is clear no matter how much ambient light is in the room. I can also easily adjust the picture to fit the layout of my viewing area. And, the speaker is good enough that I don't need external support — though pickier movie viewers may want a little more oomph. Keep reading to learn more about my six months of experience with this Epson projector.The Home Cinema 3800 is one of Epson's most compact and affordable 4K PRO-UHD projectors. 4K PRO-UHD is Epson's proprietary 4K enhancement technology that shifts each pixel to achieve double Full HD resolution on screen. Though the resulting resolution isn't technically the same as native 4K, the pixel-shifting does provide an improvement over a regular Full HD image.Here are some other key specifications:For the complete specs, check out the Best Buy product page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n          The Epson Home Cinema 3800 features several ports for external devices, including two HDMI 2.0 connections.\n        \n\n            James Brains/Business Insider\n          \n\nThe setup process is seamless for a projector of this type. Within five minutes of tearing the box open, I had an image displayed from my Chromebook. In another five minutes, I had fine-tuned the image to match the landscape of my living room.The 3800 is designed to meet a wide variety of installation options. You can choose from front, rear, front ceiling, or rear ceiling setups. Two 18 Gbps HDMI 2.0 inputs are included with 4K HDR playback support at up to 60Hz. This makes it easy to connect the projector to an external media device, like a streaming box or a game console, without any issues. Due to the layout and obstacles in my living room, I have not been able to find a good ceiling mount system. Instead, I usually put projectors on a bookshelf to the side of the room at an awkward angle to my Best Choice Products 119-inch screen. Thankfully, the Epson 3800's keystone correction feature allows you to adjust the device's projection to compensate for unconventional placement like this. Once adjusted, the keystone correction makes the image appear as if the projector is almost perpendicular to the screen. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          The projector uses 3LCD technology to produce bright images.\n        \n\n            James Brains/Business Insider\n          \n\nThe Epson 3800 uses 3LCD technology, a system that Epson invented in the late '80s and other brands have since adopted. 3LCD tends to have a higher color light output and less power usage compared to single-chip DLP projectors. You also avoid the \"rainbow\" effect where incorrect colors are perceived — an issue for many viewers of DLP projectors. And, compared to LCoS and 3-chip DLP, 3LCD projectors are usually more affordable.In my time testing projectors, I've learned that you can't really trust the lumens — the standard measure of brightness — reported by a manufacturer. The best way to judge how well a projector performs is to test it in a variety of conditions. To see how the projector handles a 4K image, I watched a test video featuring an assortment of colorful landscapes. With both artificial and natural light flooding the room, the Epson 3800 offers an impressive picture. Home theater projectors are typically designed with dark room use in mind, so it's always nice when a model is able to still perform well with ambient light in the room. With that said, the contrast between darker colors is harder to see when the lights are on. But, turning the lights off and loosely blocking some of the daylight creeping in my room makes the contrast much better.You can choose from four color modes to customize how images are displayed based on the ambient light. The options are Dynamic for a bright room, Bright Cinema for a room with closed curtains, Natural for a dark room, and Cinema for color movies in a dark room. Additionally, it's easy to adjust the brightness, contrast, color saturation, tint, sharpness, and more. And, the Auto Iris can adjust the brightness based on the scene.In addition to regular HD and 4K playback, the Epson 3800 includes support for high dynamic range (HDR) videos using the HDR10 format. HDR movies and shows are available on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, as well as several streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon Prime Video. If you watch an HDR video using a compatible media player, this feature enables the Epson 3800 to produce enhanced contrast and color. It's also worth noting that this model can support 10-bit processing and 60Hz for a smooth HDR image.On the downside, the Epson 3800 isn't actually capable of supporting the wide DCI-P3 color gamut. This means that you'll notice less of an improvement in colors when watching HDR videos on this projector than you would on a more expensive model that does support DCI-P3. 4K HDR movies, like \"The Greatest Showman,\" still look good on the Epson 3800, with solid highlights and nicely detailed textures. The scene where Rebecca Ferguson's character sings \"Never Enough\" is especially impressive. The shining spotlight on stage shows off the projector's brightness capabilities, and the highlights contrast well with darker aspects of the picture. Some scenes are prone to a slightly washed-out look, but this level of performance is similar to other models in this price range. Though HDR is still a nice feature to have, given some of the 3800's color limitations, HDR simply isn't as big a selling point for this particular model as it is for more advanced projectors and TVs. When it comes to sound, the Epson 3800 features an integrated 10W stereo speaker system. To assess the speakers, I turned the volume up to 11 (actually 40) and measured the decibels from six feet away using a sound meter. The meter achieved a high reading of 90 decibels, which is similar to what you might hear from a personal stereo. If you have an external speaker, the projector can easily pair with it via Bluetooth or an audio cable.I have a collection of songs I use to assess the lows, mids, and highs of any speaker, and I used these to assess the Epson 3800 projector's speakers. Both the mids and bass are a bit muddy, especially when the volume is turned up. At each level, the highs sound clear. This is all to be expected from two small 10W speakers. So, while the speakers are impressive for a projector, you'll want to connect your media players to an external system if you're looking for a true movie theater experience.Though the speaker is loud, the projector runs quietly. You hear it fire up when you first turn it on, but  the noise is never an issue while playing videos, even when sitting directly under it. The manufacturer rates the noise level at 35 decibels, which is accurate in my experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          With versatile picture performance, the Epson Home Cinema 3800 is a good fit for daytime and home theater use.\n        \n\n            James Brains/Business Insider\n          \n\nDespite a few drawbacks, I'm impressed with the Epson Home Cinema 3800. The images are outstanding for a broad range of videos, the audio is good for a projector, and it's suitable for a variety of situations. With brightness levels high enough to work well during daytime viewing, and even better contrast in a dark home theater setting, the Home Cinema 3800 is a strong all-around projector for this price range. The handy adjustment features also make it easy to install in more unconventional setups.Whether you should buy this projector or not depends on your needs and budget. If you want to recreate the theater experience in your home with standard dynamic range videos, then this projector has your visual needs covered. If advanced HDR playback is more of a concern for you, then the Epson 3800 does have some color limitations that you should keep in mind.If picture quality and features like 4K playback aren't a major consideration, then you can save money by going with a more affordable alternative (see below.)You might also consider the Epson Home Cinema 3800 if you want a home theater unit that can moonlight as a business projector. Since most presentations are in well-lit rooms, the Epson Home Cinema 3800 and it's solid brightness capabilities are ideally suited for this purpose. For a cheaper alternative without 4K support, I would recommend the BenQ MH535FHD 1080p DLP Home Theater Projector. This model is currently available for just $549.99. The keystone correction allows the screen to fit my room well, and it's bright enough to watch with the lights on. However, you will need external speakers with this. Plus, it's only 1080p and relies on DLP projection, which has downsides we outlined above. If you're looking for a projector with more advanced color performance, then you should consider Epson's more expensive Home Cinema 4010 projector. This model currently sells for $1,999.99, and it includes wide color capabilities which should provide more of an improvement when watching HDR videos. The Home Cinema 4010 isn't as bright as the Home Cinema 3800, however, and it doesn't include integrated speakers or 60Hz support for HDR playback. For more alternatives, check out our guides to the best home projectors and best cheap projectors.Pros: 4K resolution (using pixel-shift technology), 3,000 lumens that allows viewing with the lights on, integrated speakers, several image adjustment options, auto iris lens, three-chip LCD projection, HDR playback with 10-bit processingCons: You'll want external speakers for a more realistic movie theater experience, HDR playback does not feature expanded color supportSubscribe to our newsletter.\nYou can purchase syndication rights to this story here.\n                    Disclosure: This post is brought to you by the Insider Reviews team.

It's your new way to save, sorted.\nLast updated: 22 April 2020Straight to your inboxOne way to distinguish between the many different options is to check each projector's native resolution (the number of pixels it displays). The following are the two most popular options for HD viewing:While projectors can show signals that are higher or lower than their native resolution, they'll have to either compress the picture or scale it up to do so.The other main factor you can consider is the projection technology used:As well as image resolution and the projection technology used, there are a number of other factors you'll need to weigh up before buying an HD home theatre projector. Cost is always an important consideration, while specs such as brightness levels and contrast ratios will help determine the image quality a projector can provide.Here's what you'll need to take into account when comparing your options:This measures the difference between the blackest black and the whitest white a projector can display. A higher contrast ratio means better depth and definition of images.The brightness of projectors is measured in ANSI lumens and most models fall in the 700 - 5,000 lumens range. Brightness is an important factor that determines image and contrast quality, so it is particularly important if your viewing room isn't perfectly dark.Check what screen size you can pair with the projector. This is typically listed as a broad range and could be anywhere from 30 to 300 inches.Check how long the manufacturer claims the lamp will last before you need to replace it. Most range from 2,000 to 8,000 hours, but this figure is as much as 30,000 on some models with LED bulbs. Consider how much use you'll get out of a projector before you need to replace the lamp as well as how much that lamp will cost.You'll also need to consider where you plan to place the projector in your living room. For example, will it be projecting directly onto the screen, placed to one side or mounted from the ceiling? Ceiling mounting is often the neatest option and also means you don't have to worry about anyone walking in front of the projection.Check the manufacturer's specs to find out how far the projector needs to be from the screen to produce the best results – this is commonly referred to as the throw ratio or throw difference. Some models are \"short throw\" projectors that can be situated just a few inches back from the screen.Finally, when choosing where to place your projector, remember to consider where its infrared sensors are located to make sure you'll be able to use its remote from wherever you are sitting.While you can use your HD projector to project images onto a plain white wall, this will lead to a reduction in picture quality and a less immersive overall viewing experience. For the best results, you'll also need to invest in a special projector screen.Typically available in sizes ranging from 90 to 140 inches (but you can go much bigger if you wish), these screens are coated to improve their reflective characteristics and commonly feature a black frame to help focus your attention on the image.There are fixed-frame and retractable options available, and prices start at around $300 but go well past the $1,000 mark for larger models. Make sure you think of an HD projector itself as a two-piece set – the projector and the screen – and factor the cost of a screen into your budget.If you're still deciding, check out some reasons why you may or may not want to buy an HD home theatre projector.

Optoma debuted not one, but two of them in the second-half of 2019, and now BenQ is hot on their heels with a shiny new offering of its own. The new BenQ gaming projector delivers 3,500-lumens of brightness, which should theoretically do well in a wide variety of environments. Support for HDR is onboard, bringing higher contrast and a more colorful picture into the mix. That’s great and all, but the real appeal for gamers comes with a 120Hz refresh rate and 8.3-millisecond input lag. Continue reading to learn more.\n\n\t\t\t(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\t\tWhen it comes to gaming, high resolution is often not nearly as coveted as a high refresh rate. BenQ is addressing this boost in its new TH685 projector. Once armed with this unit, gamers will be able to see twice as many frames per second on supported platforms. Not only does gameplay look smoother, it can also provide a competitive edge when playing against others relying on a 60Hz display.BenQ makes hooking up a PC or game console to its latest projector simple with two HDMI 2.0 ports in tow. When either is utilized, input lag will only be 8.3-milliseconds, once again providing a competitive edge. The lamp inside of this projector products 3,500-lumens of brightness, helping ensure that it remains visible in a wide variety of lighting conditions.“The new TH685 creates spectacular visuals in any lighting environment, so consumers can enjoy high-quality content anywhere in their home,” said Steve Yang, director of BenQ Corporation.BenQ’s new TH685 gaming projector is available for purchase now. It’s priced at $799, which is on par with competition seen in Optoma HD39HDR and GT1080HDR. It can currently be nabbed from Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H.I purchased my first projector over 5-years ago, I am still using it to this day and am happy to report that I have yet to replace the original lamp. This should serve as a testament to the longevity you can expect in the latest BenQ gaming projector. It’s rated to deliver up to a 15,000-hour lamp life, which theoretically offers 120-minutes of usage per day for 20-years.This along with a 120Hz refresh rate and 8.3-millisecond input lag make it a long-term gaming investment worth considering. It’s a shame that the output resolution tops out at 1080p, but that’s how BenQ is able to deliver 120Hz at a competitive price point. I mean, Alienware’s 4K display with 120Hz costs several thousand dollars, and this BenQ gaming projector clocks in for a fraction of that.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.
