    "https://www.businessinsider.sg/best-desktop-computer": "\n  Computer components have gotten smaller, more compact, and more  powerful through recent years. Nowadays, you can find people  using laptops as their main computer rather than desktops. This  doesn’t necessarily mean there isn’t an ideal place for one of  the best desktop computers in your home or office.   Laptops just happen to be more capable to handle a multitude of  tasks that people want completed in a quick time frame and in  different locations. However, many desktop computers offer more  power than a simple laptop could.   For example, gamers need to be able to run high-performance games  without running into any issues, namely through a dedicated  graphics card. Likewise, video and audio editors need a powerful  processor to handle high-resolution files as well as the specific  programs (Adobe Premiere, Final Cut, etc.) needed to get their  work done.  Even the average joe may want a desktop computer too, because  they can easily be customized to their specific needs and allow  for wider connectivity with more ports. Now, on to our top picks.  In our experience, the Dell XPS  Special Edition is the best desktop computer you can buy.  Compared to its fellow Dell desktops, the XPS Special Edition  offers quite a bit more in regards to storage space and  processing power. Unlike the Dell XPS  Tower, the XPS Special Edition is a bit more on the expensive  side.   The Dell XPS Special Edition starts at $929.99 and is quite  customizable per your preference. You can get either a 9th  generation Core i5-9400 CPU or go for a more powerful Core  i7-9700 chip. The RAM options range from 8GB to 64GB, and the  desktop offers quite a bit of storage space, making it perfect  for saving your files, music, pictures, and more.   Another bonus to the Dell XPS Special Edition is that you can  choose which high-powered graphics card you want, like the NVIDIA  GeForce GTX 1660 or the AMD Radeon RX 5700.   It’s safe to say that you’ll be able to get the exact  specifications that you want for general use or even a bit of  gaming. Of course, the more powerful components you choose, the  more you’ll have to pay. If the Dell XPS Special Edition is over  your budget, you can always take a look at the Dell XPS Tower, a  small step down. Both desktops offer the same components, only  the Dell XPS Special Edition has a higher-power processor and is  VR compatible, which is a bonus for PC gamers.   The Dell XPS Special Edition has an optical drive, three USB 3.1  Gen-1 ports and one USB Type-C 3.1 port in the front. In the  back, it has two USB 2.0 ports, three USB ports 3.1 Gen 1, one  USB Type-C 3.1 port, one USB 3.1 port, one DisplayPort, and one  HDMI port. That’s enough to connect you to everything you need.  As for VR, this computer can bring quite the experience with  either HTC Vive or Oculus Rift.  We aren’t the only ones that like the Dell XPS Special Edition.    PC Magazine gave the four stars out of five, praising it for  almost everything except the slightly audible noise of the top  fan when the computer is on. You’ll also need to buy a display  separately – the computer comes with a keyboard and mouse, but no  display. Pros: Stylish, customizable, lots of options,  plenty of ports Cons: Expensive   Again, desktops offer a lot for people needing a simple computer  with enough power and storage space for their work documents and  files. However, for gamers, they need a high-powered computer  with a strong processor, lots of storage space, and an impressive  graphics card. If you’re looking for a computer that offers all  of this, then the Corsair One  i164 is the desktop for you.   There are plenty of reasons why the Corsair One i164 is the best  gaming computer on the market. For starters, it’s beautifully  designed with a sleek, black shell and blue-green lit highlights.  Apart from it’s nice looking design, this computer comes with the  top-of-the-line Intel Core i9-9900k quad-core CPU. The graphics  card in this bad boy is even more amazing, being the Nvidia  GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This will make your gaming experience more  enjoyable. Also, for video editors, graphic designers, and other  creative folks, the graphics inside this desktop will help you  bring your stunning art to life.   The RAM and storage are plentiful as well. The base model holds  up to 2TB of storage, so you can store plenty of games and other  programs on this computer.   As far as ports go, there are plenty to go around. The Corsair One  i164 has two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and one HDMI 2.0 port on the  front. But, around the back, you’ll get two USB 3.1 Gen 2 (Type-A  and Type-C) ports, two USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports, two USB 2.0 ports,  and three DisplayPorts among others.  So, what are the downsides? Techgage has discussed the many  positive attributes to the One i164, however they also discuss what the PC lacks.  Such as the limited offer of upgradability, there aren’t any air  filters which means you may have to continuously dust your PC  often, and also the price. Coming in at $3,499.99 and up on the  company’s website, Amazon, and Best Buy, the PC is a bit more  expensive for anyone that doesn’t want to go over budget.  Pros: Ultra powerful, plenty of ports on the  back, stylish design Cons: Expensive, limited ports on the front,  limited user upgradability  Being well known for their computers, phones, and other  electronics, Apple tends to be the go-to spot for people who are  computer shopping. With it’s chic, clean, and elegant design,  powerful processor, and gorgeous graphics, it’s no wonder why  most people prefer Apple’s  iMac over Windows desktops.  The Apple iMac comes in two different display sizes. You can  choose between a 21.5-inch display or a 27-inch display. Both  display types come with the latest and updated Intel Core  processors, ranging from the 8th generation and 9th generation.  This will make your computing experience much faster and  smoother. They also come with a 2TB hard drive, offering more  storage space for your files, music, videos, work notes, and  more. The computer also includes a keyboard, mouse, power cord,  and a Lightning-to-USB cable.  Perhaps the best thing about the iMac is its beautiful all-in-one  design. The computer is built into a large display, so you get an  attractive screen along with a relatively powerful computer. Not  to mention, you can easily link up your iPhone to your iMac, so  you save all your information on your iCloud. The iMac is  relatively compatible with most computer programs – such as Adobe  Premiere, Final Cut X, Compressor, BlackMagic Studios, and more –   as well as Microsoft Office programs. This is perfect for people  needing a high-performance Mac to get their jobs done.   The iMac isn’t like most PC’s when it comes to ports. There are  four USB 3 ports, two thunderbolt 3 (USB-C) ports, and a Ethernet  port. From what you can see, it’s not a lot of ports. But what  the iMac lacks with ports, it makes up for with the macOS and  it’s strong core processor.   So, what are the downsides? Well, the iMac is a little on the  expensive side. The pricing can expand if you’re looking to  upgrade the Intel Core processor with Turbo boost. For gamers,  some games on Steam or on other digital game stores may not  perform as well on macOS as they do on Windows, because of the  Mac’s inferior gaming performance without using an external  graphics card option.   Plenty of reviewers loved the computer, too. TechRadar  and   MacWorld both gave the computer a hefty four out of five  stars. Pros: Striking design, can get powerful with  upgrades before checkout, macOS is easy to use Cons: Expensive  Are you looking for a computer that’s more on the smaller side,  leaving you with more desk space? Then the Lenovo  IdeaCentre 310s may be the computer for you. This compact  desktop comes with a smooth silver design, strong processing  power, and even comes with a keyboard and mouse. It’s dimensions  come in at 11.69 x 3.54 x 13.54 inches.  Despite its first look appearance, this desktop performs really  well. Built with long-lasting performance, it uses an AMD A4-9125  processor and uses AMD Integrated Graphics. It’s base model has a  1TB hard drive and can hold up to 4GB of memory. This may not  seem like much for some people but, if you’re someone that needs  a decently performing computer for your space-strapped home  office, then this desktop is perfect for you.   What about ports? Well, there are two USB 3.0 ports in the front,  four USB 3.0 ports (two in the front and two in the back), one  VGA port, and one HDMI port. Again, this may not offer as many  ports as other desktops, but it’s enough to connect your monitor,  printer, speakers, etc.   The Lenovo IdeaCentre 310s is ranked at 4.3 out of 5  stars on Best Buy, with most customers agreeing that the PC  offers just enough for a good price.  Pros: Well-designed, relatively powerful, slim  and compact, reasonable price Cons: Needs more RAM options, more ports would  be nice  We understand that looking for a desktop computer can be a bit  frustrating, since there are so many options to choose from. Not  to mention, if you are on a tight budget, then it may be nearly  impossible to find a desktop under $500. Don’t be discouraged by  this, for there are plenty of desktops that are under $500 – for  example, the Acer Aspire TC  Desktop.   The Acer Aspire TC Desktop is a sleek, simply designed computer  that offers enough processing power and hard disk space for all  your files and other important information. With a 9th-generation  Intel Core i5-9400 processor and between 8GB to 32GB of RAM, this  computer should run smoothly for you. The base model offers 1TB  of hard disk space, which is plenty of space but lacking the  speed of solid-state storage. But, if you’re someone that wants a  simple and affordable computer for work, then this computer is  ideal for you.   When it comes to ports, the computer has one USB 3.1 port on the  front, along with six USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI ports, and one VGA  port on the back. Making it easier for you to connect your  computer to your monitor, speakers, television, and more.  The Acer Aspire TC  865 Desktop has positive reviews by customers on  Amazon, most agreeing the PC is perfect for your home office. Pros: Plenty of connectivity, deep value for  your money, decent performance, sleek design  As with any computer, there are a few things to keep in mind when  you’re browsing for your next desktop. For starters, you’ll want  to think about the operating system (OS) that  you prefer: Windows or macOS. Of course, the OS comes down to  one’s personal preference. A good number of people happen to find  that macOS is easier to use than Windows. However, Windows  computers are on the cheaper side compared to Macs, and are  widely more compatible with various programs and external  devices.  You’ll also want to think about how powerful you need the  computer to be. Most of the computers on this list feature Intel  Core i processors (CPUs), which come in a range  of models. At the most basic level, the entry-level CPU is the  i3, the mid-range is between the i5 and i7, and the high-powered  option is the i9. Additionally, gamers and visual media  professionals need to consider the graphics card  inside the computer, with the Nvidia GeForce RTX series being the  highest-end graphics cards available today.  Apart from the processor, there’s memory, or  RAM, which impacts the overall speed and  day-to-day use as well as multitasking capability – we would  recommend at least 8GB of RAM; and storage,  which dictates how many files, including videos and music, can be  stored on the desktop. For this, we’d recommend going for at  least 256GB of space to start.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('dfp-ad-imu2'); });\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n ‘That makes no sense’: Anderson Cooper stunned by Las Vegas mayor during wild CNN interview \n I’ve only been using Apple’s new iPhone SE for a few hours, but it already feels like exactly what the company needs to upstage Android ri... \n Singapore is less prepared than Malaysia to deal with a pandemic, EIU report says \n 100 online courses from Coursera are $0 now through May 31 — here’s a list of all the classes open for free enrollment \n Air-conditioning spread the coronavirus to 9 people sitting near an infected person in a restaurant, researchers say.

For streaming movies, web browsing, photos, and other general use the Apple iMac can’t be beaten.\"\"This 'all-in-one' computer packs all its hardware into the display itself, so you don't need a big tower on your desk,\" added Whitson Gordon, a tech writer with over a decade of experience. \"They're a bit more expensive for the performance you get, but for many, it's well worth it.\"This Dell all-in-one desktop is comparable to the iMac but slightly less expensive.\"This is a good choice for someone who doesn't want to spend the additional money on an iMac,\" noted Hale. \"It's a decent computer in a brown paper bag. Its chassis design is passable, and the hardware specs are good for your everyday computing.\"\"The Dell Inspiron is a great way to save space on your desk if you don't have room for a desktop tower,\" added Gordon. \"It's also much less money than a comparable iMac, if Apple's offerings cost too much for your taste.\"If you're not interested in using multiple monitors but want the extra screen space, this is a match made in heaven.\"The HP Curved Envy is both beautiful in design an immersive due to the 34-inch curved display,\" said Hale. \"Working on larger screens for many hours makes a world of difference in both productivity and ergonomics.\"This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service\"Ultrawide monitors, like the one on HP's Envy Curved All-in-One, are amazing,\" said Gordon. \"You get a whole lot more real estate on your screen for putting multiple windows side-by-side, which is great for getting work done. On top of that, HP offers some solid configurations with great performance.\"This is by far the most expensive desktop on the list but Gordon says it's worth the upgrade if you're into graphic design and illustrations.\"An all-in-one similar to the iMac or HP Envy, but targeted directly at artists and creatives,\" said Gordon. \"With a gorgeous touch screen that folds down horizontally, you can use the Surface Pen or Surface Dial for art and design in a way few desktop PCs can match. It's more expensive than most, but it's also extremely unique and has great performance to boot.\"The HP ProDesk GF is perfect for those who use a lot of different applications or programs, says Hale.\"For the office and remote worker, I highly recommend the HPProDesk G5,\" he said. \"Having a solid-state drive, the HP Pro Desk will fly you through Microsoft Office documents and websites in a flash. It’s as small as a box of tissues, quiet, and gives off minimal heat, all at a budget-friendly price.\"The Apple Mac Mini is a good way to get the support of a desktop computer without shelling out a ton of money and saving some extra desk space.\"If you're on more of a budget, the Mac Mini is a great alternative but you'll need to provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor,\" said Gordon.\"The Mac Mini by Apple is iconic in its design. Small, fast, and starting at $699, it provides everything the home or productivity user needs who prefers the Apple macOS to work and play in,\" Hale added.If you want more computer storage and have space at your desk, a tower desktop may be a good choice for you.\"This desktop definitely isn’t the prettiest of the bunch. But the Dell XPS Tower packs enough horsepower for the user into casual gaming and creative work,\" said Hale. \"You get a strong system with enough room to expand (hardware) with its voluminous case for years to come.\"The HP Omen Obelisk Desktop is perfect if you like to play video games. You'll have more than enough space for all of your favorite games and plenty of more room for all your important documents and photos.\"The design of the case looks like it was left behind by an alien mothership,\" Hale said. \"The HP Omen will give you out of this world gaming performance with plenty of room to expand.

This option removes barriers for tribal members who choose to utilize our clinic’s medical services,” said Charlie White, KIC Tribal Administrator. “While our team had already been exploring how to best implement telehealth services, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our efforts.”Non-emergency medical appointments are now available through Doxy.me, a full-service telehealth solution. The platform allows providers and patients to see each other during their appointment through a desktop computer, smartphone, or tablet. Providers can evaluate and diagnose symptoms, provide treatment advice, and write prescriptions without patients leaving their homes.Doxy.me is HIPAA compliant and does not require any software to be downloaded or applications to be installed.“During this time of social distancing and self-quarantine, we believe that telehealth is an excellent tool that will enhance the way KIC Tribal Health Clinic practices medicine,” said Catherine Keene, KIC Tribal Health Clinic Director.  “This option allows for continuity of care, will not affect the quality of service, and enables us to further protect the community by limiting patient and provider exposure to serious illnesses.”Many primary and behavioral health services are available through the new telehealth model including evaluation of common illness and injury, chronic diagnosis management, medication refills, review and order of labs and imaging, referrals as needed, and elder check-ins. For the remainder of the pandemic, in-person appointments are limited and are being scheduled on a case by case basis.   \n                Juneau, Alaska (KINY) - To slow the spread of COVID-19, the State of Alaska is issuing its 17th health mandate, based on its authority under the Public Health Disaster Emergency Declaration signed by Governor Mike Dunleavy on March 11.\n            \n                Juneau, Alaska (KINY) - The Mat-Su school board has voted to ban the use of the New York Times as curriculum and also banned five books.\n            \n                Juneau, Alaska (AP) - A judge has ordered the state to pay about $96,000 in attorneys' fees in a school funding dispute. \n            \n                Dillingham, Alaska (KINY) - Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation is opposing the opening of the 2020 commercial fishing season in order to protect the 28 villages it serves within the region. \n            \n                Seattle (KINY) - Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air have received $992 million in the form of a $725 million grant and $267 million loan, to be used exclusively toward continuing to pay employee salaries, wages and benefits. \n            \n                Juneau, Alaska (KINY) - The Kootznoowoo, Inc.

    "https://www.bobvila.com/slideshow/10-home-electronics-you-never-clean-but-really-should-53464": "Home electronics occupy a prominent place in our daily lives. We touch them repeatedly, share them with other family members, and leave them out to collect dust and grime, and yet we don't generally include them in our regular cleaning routine—and that's a big mistake. As important as it is to keep your hands clean, it's just as important to keep your electronics clean so they don't become reservoirs for germs. Read on to learn some quick-clean tricks for common home electronics that will get your devices germ- and dust-free.An important note before before you grab your cleaning supplies: Unlike other items in your home, your electronic devices are coated with special finishes and contain electrical components that may be sensitive to harsh cleaners and abrasives. Always check the manufacturer’s instructions before you try to clean a device to ensure that you don't damage it in the process.istockphoto.comIt’s not just a dirty rumor: Every square inch of your cellphone is covered with roughly 25,127 bacteria. That’s more bacteria than are found on a public doorknob. Fight back by keeping your cellphones and tablets clean with a regular wipe down. While you can purchase specialty cleaning fluid or UV lights to disinfect your screens, it’s easier to dampen a microfiber cloth with a mix of 60 percent water and 40 percent isopropyl alcohol, and wipe down your screens daily. Microfiber cloths are best because they will not scratch surfaces. Be sure to power down your phone or tablet prior to cleaning just in case there’s a spill.istockphoto.comYou don't touch your computer or laptop screen as often as you touch your cellphone, but those screens can still collect fingerprints and dust. To clean the monitors, power down your computer or laptop, then mix a drop of dish soap into a few cups of warm water. Dip a microfiber cloth into the mix, and squeeze out the excess water. Wipe down the screens to remove any smudges and dirt, then rinse out the cloth with clean water and wipe down again. Use a dry microfiber cloth to remove any lingering drops of moisture and eliminate streaks. If you're cleaning a desktop computer, pay special attention to the computer tower. The tower has vents to expel hot air and keep the system cool. These vents often get clogged with dust, which may affect how the computer runs. Use a vacuum or dusting cloth to clean off the vents, and then wipe down the tower with a damp microfiber cloth. If you see a lot of dust inside the tower, you may need to open the case so you can clean off the dust. If you'd rather not remove the cover, you can schedule a professional cleaning service for your computer. Dust your computer tower weekly, and give it a wipe down once a month.istockphoto.comResearchers from the University of Arizona found that an office desktop can harbor 400 times more bacteria than a toilet seat, and plenty of those bacteria settle on the keyboard and computer mouse. Because the keyboard and mouse are touched so frequently, they should be cleaned regularly to keep germs at bay.To clean the keyboard, first disconnect it from the power source. Use a can of compressed air to remove dust and debris from the crevices between the keys. Lightly dab a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and clean each of the keys using a light circular motion, then dry them off with a microfiber cloth. Clean the mouse by spraying it with rubbing alcohol and wiping it down with a microfiber cloth. Clean your keyboard and mouse weekly, and after each use if you have a cold.istockphoto.comHome printers may not get as germy as other electronics, but they do get dusty. To keep your printer in good working order, dust it off as part of your cleaning routine. Most printers have a cleaning function that takes care of the ink nozzles, so you probably don't have to mess with them. But it's a good idea to use a can of compressed air or a small handheld vacuum cleaner to remove any dust that builds up inside the printer. To take care of dirt, fingerprints, and ink smudges on the outside of the printer, wipe it down with a soft cloth moistened in water. Try to dust your printer weekly and wipe it down monthly.istockphoto.comHeadphones and earphones make direct contact with your skin. Over time, they can become coated in sweat and wax as well as dust and dirt. For over-the-ear headphones, it is best to wipe them with a microfiber cloth dampened with a little water and soap, and then let them air-dry. Earphones that don't have ear tips that go inside your ear canal should be cleaned only with a dry microfiber cloth (no moisture or cleaning solution). Remove buildups of wax or dust by dabbing adhesive putty into the gunky areas. If the earphones have rubber coverings over the speaker, remove them and wipe them down separately. You should clean headphones and earphones weekly.istockphoto.comClean television screens in the same manner as laptop or computer screens: Wipe them down with a microfiber cloth dipped into warm water mixed with a drop of dish soap. Cleaning the remote control, however, takes a little more work. Start by opening the back of the remote and removing the batteries. Gently shake the remote to loosen any crumbs, then use compressed air to remove any lingering debris from the crevices between the buttons. Then, dip a microfiber cloth in a 60 to 70 percent solution of rubbing alcohol and wipe down the surface. Use a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol to clean around the buttons. Let the remote air-dry, then replace the \nbatteries. Clean TV screens and remotes weekly, but if someone in the house is sick, clean the remote every day.\nistockphoto.comSmart speakers like Amazon Echos and Google Home devices are easy to clean with a damp microfiber cloth. If your device has a screen, clean it just as you would a computer screen. Smart speakers should be cleaned weekly.istockphoto.comGame consoles and their controllers need to be cleaned often to keep germs under control and to function effectively. Clean the controllers in the same manner as a remote control, and clean the console as you would a computer tower. Do not, however, open the console to clean it; leave that to the professionals. Dust consoles and wipe off controllers weekly, but if you or someone else in your household is sick, clean controllers after every use.istockphoto.comMost of us do not even think about these essential boxes until they stop working. They are often tucked in a corner, out of sight, and those that live on the floor get coated with dust and pet hair. Like computer towers, these boxes have vents to help release the heat they generate. Give your router or modem a weekly dusting and a wipe down with a dry microfiber cloth at least once a month to keep it in good working condition.istockphoto.comThose cunning little devices that bring you all the joys of Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and more often get ignored during cleaning. But though they may be inconspicuous, they do get dusty. The good news is, it doesn’t take much work to clean them. Just a simple wipe down when you're cleaning the TV will keep them in good condition.istockphoto.comWant a cleaner, tidier, more organized home?
