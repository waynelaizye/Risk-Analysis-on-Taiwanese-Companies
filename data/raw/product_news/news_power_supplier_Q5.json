    "https://www.utilitydive.com/news/colorado-expedites-tri-state-member-exit-charge-case-as-power-supplier-get/574990/": "Tri-State is moving forward with efforts to add more renewable energy and give member companies greater control over their own supply, but FERC's decision opens a route for LPEA and United to go their own way.\"Even though it's a split decision, I'd call it a big victory for the two co-ops,\" Eric Frankowski, executive director of Western Clean Energy Campaign, said in an email to Utility Dive.Tri-State says it is in the process of eliminating 100% of coal emissions in New Mexico by the end of 2020, and 100% of coal emissions in Colorado by 2030. The G&T provider is adding more than 1,000 MW of new wind and solar resources, and says by 2024, 50% of the energy consumed through Tri-State’s members will come from emissions-free renewable energy.Tri-State also says it is working to expand flexibility for members to self-supply power and develop more local renewable energy. The utility says its members will be able to express their intent to transition to partial requirements contracts by participating in an upcoming open season, to allocate an aggregate 300 MW of system-wide member self-supply capacity.The open season capacity is 10% of Tri-State’s system peak demand. A date has not been set for the open season, but Tri-State says it will be held later this year.\"We value all of our members. The significant changes at Tri-State are closely aligned with our members’ desires,\" Tri-State spokesman Mark Stutz said in an email. \"The changes at Tri-State are member-driven.According to LPEA CEO Jessica Matlock, the changes do not go far enough.\"This is a step in the right direction but in order to fully evaluate all of its options LPEA needs an exit charge to be set by the COPUC,\" Matlock said in an email. \"Even though Tri-State has proposed methodologies around an open season (or partial requirements), without understanding what a full exit looks like from a financial perspective, LPEA cannot compare the relative costs and benefits of increased self-supply with a complete exit and a contract with a new wholesale provider.\"United Power said much the same in a statement.“United Power has been very methodical in our approach to determining our course forward in regard to wholesale power,” said Chief Energy Resource Officer Dean Hubbuck. “We are weighing the cost and mix of power we receive from Tri-State with other options in the energy marketplace, and we need the PUC to provide an accurate and fair exit charge so we can make good decisions for our Cooperative’s future on behalf of our membership.”​Colorado regulators ruled Wednesday that an Administrative Law Judge will preside over a hearing and ordered an expedited pre-hearing conference on the exit charge requests. According to Matlock, \"all that remains in the case is the evidentiary hearing and final briefing.\" Pre-filed testimony has already been submitted.Tri-State says its members believe, however, that they should make decisions about their contracts with Tri-State, according to Stutz. \"Our board of directors has asked the membership’s Contract Committee to develop a uniform contract termination fee methodology,\" he said.Tri-State says its FERC tariff filing, which brings it under federal jurisdiction, was designed to provide consistent rates across all of its four-state territory. \"The orders recognize that Tri-State became jurisdictional to the FERC on Sept. 3, 2019, when we added our first non-utility member,\" Stutz said.California-based MIECO, Tri-State's new member, is a subsidiary of Marubeni Corp. and supplies gas to Tri-State power plants.Matlock sees things differently.\"The primary reason Tri-State sought to eliminate its FERC exemption was to preempt the Colorado PUC’s jurisdiction over exit charges,\" Matlock said. \"Here is the outcome of Tri-State’s FERC strategy: a two-fer of a far-reaching and expensive federal regulatory regime, and continued oversight at the state level involving exit charge litigation. In other words, it did not accomplish what it was intended to achieve.\"Follow\n                                    \n                                    \n                                        Robert Walton\n                                    \n                                    on\n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Twitter\n                                        \nSubscribe to Utility Dive to get the must-read news & insights in your inbox.Topics covered: smart grid tech, clean energy, regulation, generation, and much more.The free newsletter covering the top industry headlinesTopics covered: smart grid tech, clean energy, regulation, generation, and much more.The free newsletter covering the top industry headlinesTopics covered: smart grid tech, clean energy, regulation, generation, and much more.",

We do know that the city’s revenues will fall critically short.Mayor Jim Strickland had predicted pre-COVID-19 that the next fiscal year for Memphis would be difficult. He now describes it as “grim.” The city's revenue shortfall could exceed $50 million.The implications could ripple throughout Memphis. City-owned attractions could be shuttered. Community centers and libraries could close. Potholes will have to wait.It’s the local chapter in a national story: cities struggling to fund vital public services. In Memphis, it doesn’t have to be that way. It is in a unique position to offset lost revenue while unlocking hundreds of millions of dollars more.All it takes is leaving TVA and purchasing electricity less expensively from another reliable supplier. For two years this decision has been slow walked by city and MLGW officials, crying out for visionary leadership and a sense of urgency.Tom Jones (Photo: Submitted)Four major studies — one even commissioned by MLGW — agree: Memphis could save as much as $450 million a year if MLGW leaves TVA and joins Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), a nonprofit distributor of electric power in our border states. The math is simple: MLGW pays TVA $75 per megawatt-hour for electric power, or nearly $1 billion annually. MLGW sells that power to you and me.If Memphis joins MISO — four times larger than TVA and serving 15 states and part of Canada — MLGW would on average pay MISO about $45 per megawatt-hour. Therein lies the remarkable savings of about $450 million a year.MLGW must give TVA five years' notice to leave TVA. Should MLGW notify TVA of that intent, after a request for proposals process, MLGW then could sell as much as $1 billion in municipal bonds against 2½ years of future savings. Major financial companies would sell these bonds to investors desperate for safe investments in these uncertain times.What could Memphis do with an additional $1 billion? It could remedy financial shortfalls. MLGW would have $200 million to repair its infrastructure. There would be money to fund a new MATA system, pre-K, a program for struggling small-business owners, and MLGW bills could be lowered by as much as 30%.Stopping MLGW from leaving TVA is the lethargy of entrenched bureaucratic behavior and TVA’s campaign of fear and misinformation claiming no supplier is as reliable as it is. It requires us to believe that the nation outside of TVA is living in fear, although all power providers answer to the same federal regulatory agency.Despite the four previous studies, MLGW is spending another $500,000 to hire Siemens, a German multinational conglomerate, to conduct yet a fifth study. Siemens is a TVA vendor and it is a supplier of equipment for power generation and transmission.Siemens’ trial balloon suggests that MLGW should remain with TVA or MLGW must generate its own power supply by building new power plants, contradicting the previous four studies that said the last thing Memphis should do is create and manage its own costly power supply.Siemens’ other red herrings: MLGW will not be able to use TVA’s transmission lines, it will cost too much to build another transmission line across the river to connect with MISO, or that Memphis will need hundreds of acres to build wind and solar farms.It’s hard to imagine that Siemens will objectively resolve the crucial question of Memphis’ best power supplier considering the inherent conflicts, not to mention that MLGW’s cozy relationship with TVA calls into question the objectivity of its own deliberations.Faced with the possibility that Memphis may leave, TVA raised its visibility here. TVA has lobbied civic and political leaders and doled out millions of dollars for politically important projects. It suddenly discovered its footprint is more than just Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville, cities for years that have enjoyed TVA’s largesse subsidized by Memphis ratepayers, not to mention the $8.1 million annual salary of TVA’s president, Jeff Lyash, the highest paid federal employee.  MLGW has appeared before Memphis City Council multiple times in recent months seeking to raise our electric bills by an average of $14 per month, or $168 per year, in a city where the poverty rate exceeds 40% in five ZIP codes.When thousands of MLGW ratepayers have lost their jobs, when incomes here already lag behind other communities, and when poverty continues to grip too many of our fellow residents, what is the logic in raising electric rates again when the money needed for infrastructure upgrades and major city improvements is only a decision away?If MLGW leadership lacks the vision to make the right decision for the residents of Memphis and leave TVA, then it’s time for our elected officials to make this decision for them. Time is of the essence. Tom Jones is principal at Smart City Consulting and author of the Smart City Memphis blog.© 2020 commercialappeal.com, All rights reserved."
