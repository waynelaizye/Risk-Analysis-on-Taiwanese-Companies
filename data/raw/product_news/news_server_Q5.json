While the Fortnite Event time has been set for midnight GMT (7pm ET) on April 23, servers will be opening early.That means you can secure your Fortnite Astronomical event place at 11:30pm GMT (6:30pm ET) today, on PS4, Xbox One, PC, Switch and PC. More details regarding today's event can be found below.ORIGINAL: Epic Games is offering a big new Fortnite event to enjoy on all platforms, and that means there's going to be plenty of people trying to secure a server spot. The good news is that the Travis Scott Concert will be happening several times this week, starting on April 23 in the United States (early morning April 24 in the UK). This should make it possible for everyone to gain access and watch the special live event on PS4, Xbox, Switch, PC and Mobile.But it’s almost certain that the most popular Fortnite Event Time will be the first confirmed by Epic Games.For gamers in the United States, the Travis Scott Concert has a set start time of 7pm ET. In the UK, this will be happening at Midnight on April 24.Epic Games has already said that they will be hosting the same Fortnite event at different times to make it easy for everyone to watch.Fortnite event times for Travis Scott are as follows:Epic Games is doing this because they only have a certain amount of server capacity, meaning that some people will miss out on the first night.The Fortnite support team has also made it clear that there will be no region lock, so there will be nothing stopping fans staying up late to try and tune in.A message from Epic Games confirms: “From April 23-25, blast off into a one of a kind musical journey featuring Travis Scott and the world premiere of a brand new track.“Astronomical is an other-worldly experience inspired by Cactus Jack’s creations, built from the ground up in Fortnite.“To make sure everyone has a chance to experience Astronomical, we’re setting up multiple tour dates with showtimes for players around the globe.“Jump in to whichever time fits your schedule best, or catch an encore with your friends if they missed it.”So what’s the best strategy to try and make sure you’re one of the first to experience the next Fortnite event?FORTNITE EVENT TIME - HOW TO GET A SPOTEpic Games has confirmed that Fortnite event servers for the Travis Scott Concert will be opening 30 MINUTES before the gig kicks off.So this will be the time to jump into the game and try and claim a spot to watch the Fortnite Astronomical debut.This will mean logging into Fortnite Battle Royale at 11:30pm BST on April 23 for gamers in the UK and at 6:30pm ET for those watching in the United States.A follow-up message from Epic Games confirms: “Doors open 30 minutes before each show, so get there early to secure your spot.“Our goal is to accommodate everyone possible, but if capacity is reached, please join us for one of the other shows.“The Astronomical tour dates are NOT region locked, but we’ve selected times to make sure everyone has a chance to attend.”With current world events unfolding as they are, this latest Fortnite event could be very popular when it launches this week.

Very unhappy, can’t seem to quit the app.”Independent outage monitor Down Detector has registered a surge of Discord down reports today.Out of those affected, some 90 per cent are experiencing Discord server connection issues while others are having login problems.It’s unclear what has caused tonight’s outage or how long it might last on all platforms.

Our engineers are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and we thank you for your patience.\"The most recent message from Sony reads: “You may experience somewhat slower or delayed game downloads because we're working with ISPs to manage download traffic.“We believe it's important to do our part to address internet stability concerns as an unprecedented number of people are staying home and practicing social distancing. We appreciate the support and understanding from our community.”Some PS4 gamers are able to play tonight, however, they are having issues with Parties not functioning correctly.This also includes not being able to chat together when playing online.“It says I’m appearing offline and I’m online and I can’t even join or make parties,” one PSN user writes.MFL….

    "https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/04/23/caringo-unveils-line-of-on-prem-private-cloud-swarm-server-appliances/": "\nBy SVG Staff Thursday, April 23, 2020 - 8:00 am                                                Print This Story\n\n\n\nCaringo has announced that its Swarm Object Storage is now available on a new line of Swarm Server Appliances. The on-prem private cloud storage solution starts at 168TBs in a Single Server Appliance, and scales to 100s of PBs in multi-server configurations. Swarm Server Appliances, as well as the latest version of version 11.1 of Caringo Swarm Object Storage Software, are available today.Caringo says this latest addition to its product line enables customers to reduce costs while supporting the growing demand for instantly accessible data and content for collaboration, streaming, and monetization.According to Caringo, Swarm Server Appliances start at 48% the cost of other on-prem object storage solutions and 57% less than Amazon S3 storage service fees for the same capacity over three years. Deployment is flexible and fast. Organizations can expand in a matter of minutes and easily scale to 100s of PBs with integrated backup to any S3-enabled device or service for seamless disaster recovery and cold archiving. This means that content-driven organizations can now optimize their on-prem resources and benefit from the distributed protection of the cloud while ensuring their content is instantly accessible for continued use and monetization.“We recently deployed the new Swarm Servers for a professional sports team and they were up and running in a matter of hours,” says Liz Davis, Vice President, Media Workflow Group from Diversified. “They went with Swarm Servers instead of tape to ensure they had immediate access to their videos for production and to enable streaming services in the future. We recommended Caringo due to the ease of deployment, excellent value and feature set.”In addition, version 11.1 of Caringo Swarm Object Storage Software has been released which brings enhancements to S3 protocol compatibility and performance as well as email and Slack alerting. The new update facilitates scaling for large clusters of over one-thousand nodes and integrates Elasticsearch 6 while delivering many valuable features to end users, including built- in data management, and secure file sharing.Caringo CEO Tony Barbagallo says, “Digital content and how it is consumed has dramatically changed over the past few years, forcing organizations to quickly modernize their storage infrastructure. With our new line of Swarm Server Appliances, we can help customers quickly. For more information, visit www.Caringo.com.\n© 2020 Sports Video Group. All rights reserved.

Hackers breach outdated Revive servers and silently append malicious code to existing ads.Once the tainted ads load on legitimate sites, the malicious code hijacks and redirects site visitors to websites offering malware-laced files -- usually disguised as Adobe Flash Player updates.Confiant says it identified around 60 Revive ad servers that have been compromised by this hacker group -- which the company has codenamed Tag Barnakle.The company says the group has managed to load its malicious ads on thousands of sites, with the malicious ads being broadcast to other ad companies thanks to RTB (real-time bidding) integrations between services.\"If we take a look at the volumes behind just one of the compromised RTB ad servers - we see spikes of up to 1.25 [million] affected ad impressions in a single day,\" said Eliya Stein, a Senior Security Engineer at Confiant.Stein says Tag Barnakle is a rare breed of malvertiser. Malvertising groups that hack ad servers haven't been seen operating at this scale since 2016.For the past years, most malvertising groups have operated by a different strategy -- by creating networks of fake companies that buy ads on legitimate sites, which they later modify to load malicious code.This tactic has been prevalent over the past few years because some shady ad networks are willing to turn a blind eye to malvertisers buying ads on their systems since both parties are making a profit. However, Tag Barnakle's modus operandi is not something that ad companies will be willing to put up.\"We have seen other malvertisers do this, but it's less widespread in  general for several reasons,\" Stein told ZDNet in an email. \"First of all, I believe there's a sense  among the attackers that there's a legal gray area when it comes to  malvertising, but once you compromise an ad server there is no question  that you've broken the law in a big way.\"\"It's also a different focus altogether,\" Stein added. \"I imagine not all malvertisers  have the skillset and wherewithal to actually go out and hack ad serving  infrastructure or accounts. Paying for a media buy [an ad slot] is the path of least  resistance.\"Stein tells ZDNet that Confiant has been spending the last few weeks notifying advertising companies that have been breached. However, not all advertising companies have yet to act on Confiant's warnings about Tag Barnakle so far.\"The campaign itself is ongoing among the ad servers that are still  compromised,\" Stein told ZDNet.\"We have notified the owner of every single ad server about the breach,  but not everyone has followed up with us. Some of the ad servers were impacted briefly, maybe just a matter of  days before the ad server owner patched the breach. Others continue to  be live to this day,\" he added. \"From our standpoint, we continue to block any ads on behalf of our  customers that are being served from ad placements previously associated  with the compromise.\"Stein also said that Confiant will be publishing more reports on malvertisers hacking ad servers and their tactics going forward.\n                                   By\n               \nCatalin Cimpanu\n\n            \n                    \n                    for Zero Day\n        \n                                        |            April 22, 2020 -- 13:00 GMT (21:00 GMT+08:00)\n        \n                                                                                    | Topic: Security\nNetworkingRIPE opposes China's internet protocols upgrade planSecurityNSA shares list of vulnerabilities commonly exploited to plant web shellsSecurityESET takes down VictoryGate cryptomining botnetSecurityValve says it's safe to play CS:GO and TF2 after source code leaked onlinePlease review our terms of service to complete your newsletter subscription.By registering, you agree to the Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices outlined in the Privacy Policy.You will also receive a complimentary subscription to the ZDNet's Tech Update Today and ZDNet Announcement newsletters.
