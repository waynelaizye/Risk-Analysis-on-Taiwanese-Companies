2020-04-19\n大家都知道阿輝是自由工作者，因為『自由』所以表示有更多不固定的工作時間，所以相對於有固定上下班的上班族，使用筆電的機率高出許多，同時阿輝 3C 時尚型男的身分，接觸到的筆電也比大家多一些，標準自然也比較嚴苛，當然，這是帶有主觀意識的判斷，畢竟每個人需求不同，像是有些人天身神力、帶筆電當健身，不需要輕薄這個條件，總之，不可能每個人都一樣，所以需要按照個人喜好判斷。不過以今天要介紹的 Surface Laptop 3 就可以說非常符合阿輝的需求與喜好，有些甚至超出水準，它不只外型輕薄優雅，時尚好看、多色可選，輕薄之餘效能也十分不錯，輕薄的同時具有完整的擴充連接能力，甚至可以搭配多重連接埠擴充彈性使用，這一次 Surface Laptop 3 除了原廠磁吸設計充電器之外，也可以用 TYPE-C 連接埠充電甚至是使用行動電源，還有可以支援 4096 階感壓的 Surface 手寫筆、搭配 Windows 白板功能會議討論都超方便，還能增添趣味性，配合 Windows Hello 生物辨識還能瞬間臉部解鎖不用鍵入密碼超方便！就讓阿輝一一介紹吧。 阿輝平常的工作型態相當多元，有時候會花很長時間處理文書，但有時候一樣會使用筆電寫程式或是弄弄 3D 列印的東西，無聊時當然也會用筆電追劇或是玩遊戲，而 Surface Laptop 3 基本上都能滿足阿輝的日常使用需求。Surface Laptop 3 有砂岩金色、墨黑色，鈷藍色和白金色四色可選，阿輝拿到的是墨黑色，不反光的霧黑色與微軟的四個方塊呈現明確對比，一般來說阿輝覺得黑色最無趣，可以選擇的話通常不會選黑色，不過 Surface Laptop 3 的黑色並不無趣，細緻富有層次的黑，不管在什麼光線底下，都是內斂而深沉的，還隱隱約約有種神祕的美感。螢幕稍微張開之後，一樣相當漂亮，角度帶來更豐富光澤；雖然 Surface Laptop 3 有提供不同觸感的類麂皮款式，但阿輝覺得蠻可惜這一次拿到的 Surface Laptop 3 是比較傳統的金屬 C 面版本就是了。Surface Laptop 3 設計上很大的特點是採用略帶點剛毅感的俐落角度切邊，許多朋友喜歡 Apple 的筆電，但圓角的設計沒這麼吸引阿輝，在這點上 Surface Laptop 3 具有主觀性的優勢，尤其這種冷硬剛毅、充滿男子氣概的黑色配上有稜有角的外表，完完全全就像替阿輝這種 man 度破表的男子漢量身訂做的。而且闔上之後的輕薄幹練，時尚美型也讓人一樣驚嘆，就像是某種細緻的桌面擺設，不管放在哪裡都不顯突兀，也能大大提升整體造型感。  整體造型洗煉、乾淨，沒有多餘的形狀與結構，俐落的邊角與造型讓人愛不釋手，外表漂亮，但又不是有強烈距離感的那種遙遠科技冰冷氛圍，霧黑色質感像是黑曜石，同時具有剛毅跟柔韌溫潤的氛圍；不只是外型漂亮，螢幕畫面也不遑多讓，阿輝手邊的 Surface Laptop 3 採用 13.5 吋 PixelSense™ 螢幕，解析度 2256 x 1504 (201 PPI)，10 點多點觸控，還支援 Surface 手寫筆，不管是直接用手指觸控螢幕操作，或是使用手寫筆，都非常方便。Surface Laptop 3 表面使用一層 Corning Gorilla Glass 3 玻璃不只提供色澤鮮豔，對比清晰的顯示效果，也有強悍的抗刮保護能力，雖然是 13.5 吋螢幕，但整台筆電比 13 吋的 MacBook Air 更小，螢幕大機身小而且整個螢幕都是觸控面板，方便度加倍。而且螢幕表現相當優異，不管是工作還是追劇都能提供卓越的使用體驗，畫面上的人物色澤、表情、五官甚至皮膚細緻度都很出眾。甚至玩遊戲也有相當不錯的表現，不管是畫面或是效能，都能滿足中度遊戲需求，Surface Laptop 3 搭配了第十代 Intel 處理器，使用更先進的 10nm 製程的 Intel 十代處理器搭配了 Iris 內建顯卡，輕度遊戲也沒有太大問題，這部分阿輝稍後會有詳細的性能與電力實測。正如前面提過的，阿輝手邊這台 Surface Laptop 3 是金屬 C 面，本來覺得沒有使用麂皮版本拍照給大家看有點可惜，但是金屬質感其實跟機身更有整體性，加上有 LED 背光，即便在昏暗的場所使用，也不用擔心看不到鍵盤上的字。而且鍵盤的觸感還行，即便是慣用機械鍵盤的阿輝，也能習慣於使用 Surface Laptop 3 的鍵盤敲打；筆電與家裡機械鍵盤手感不同是正常的，但有些筆電的薄膜鍵盤會讓阿輝想要另外帶一把鍵盤出門工作，但若是帶 Surface Laptop 3 外出工作，有時為求方便則不會想要再特地外接鍵盤。觸控面板也很滑順，使用起來靈敏順暢不遲緩，壓按的段差也有著不錯手感，位置與大小也相當適宜，手腕可以放置在兩側，流暢地使用而且 Surface Laptop 3 還有一個非常實用、不只在便攜性大大提升也能強化美觀的特點，就是輕薄，基本上不到少女一支手指頭粗、僅僅 1.2 公斤的輕薄機身只要合起來之後彷彿與桌面融為一體，即使筆電包中裝滿其他東西，也能輕鬆地把 Surface Laptop 3 放進包包中。阿輝測試的這款 Surface Laptop 3 預設就直接搭載了 Windows 10 Pro 作業系統，內建 16GB 記憶體，512GB SSD 固態硬碟的配置，使用的處理器是 Intel 最新第十代 Intel® Core™ i7-1065G7 處理器，採用 10nnm 製程，具備四核心八線程，並採最新 Intel Iris Plus 繪圖晶片。單核心測試的部份 CPU 跑分軟體 CPUmark99 進行測試，成績為 730 分以 PassMark PerformanceTest 9 測試，得分為 4629 分最新版 CIBENCH R20 測試模擬重度的 3D 繪圖渲染能力，得分為 1590 分大家最為期待的續航力測試，阿輝使用 PCMARK 10 的電力測試，以現代辦公模式測試，可以達到 15 小時的優異續航成績！測試模擬實際辦公與家用環境的最新版本 PCMARK 10 測試SSD 固態硬碟配置高速規格的 512GB 高速大容量固態硬碟，讀取寫入等測試都是高效表現讓 Surface Laptop 3 不管是各種辦公處理上都更能得心應手由於 Surface Laptop 3 使用的 GPU 是 Intel Iris Plus 可以說是 Intel 目前最高階的繪圖顯示單元，所以像快打旋風 4、LOL 英雄聯盟等輕度遊戲都是能盡情遊玩的3DMARK 的 Sky Diver 測試 3DMARK 最新的測試模式取得了 3573 分剛剛有提到，有些朋友還是習慣使用滑鼠，畢竟 Surface Laptop 3 已經附上所有不需要滑鼠就能使用的裝置與結構，所以原廠沒有附滑鼠，需要額外添購；只是對阿輝來說，Surface Laptop 3 的滑鼠 Arc Mouse 也是相當值得購入的配件，造型帥氣不說，光是那個符合人體工學的曲度就已經很吸引人了。Arc Mouse 使用藍牙連接方式，需要安裝兩顆四號電池使用，真的要說無線就是爽，使用更自由。在不使用的時候，Surface Laptop 3 可以變成完全平放收納，絲毫不占空間，就算跟筆電一起帶著出門也不會造成額外的負擔，不像一般傳統滑鼠都呈現圓形，出門很難攜帶在家也不易收納，大多人都呈現半放棄姿態直接把滑鼠放在桌上，但換成 Arc Mouse 的話，就可以好好的把滑鼠收納起來了。Arc Mouse 有兩種不同的材質，不只看起來有差異，拿在手上手感也不同，相當有質感。需要使用的時候只要曲起即可，就能成為一隻符合人體工學，好持握、好推送的滑鼠。放在桌上也是一個帥字，好像某種高科技產品；而且折曲起來跟平擺甚至也可以視同滑鼠開關機使用，這種設計非常聰明而且直覺。它使用觸控取代滾輪，所以看起來跟傳統滑鼠造型差異巨大，不只是更有質感更帥，也更有未來感。還有一個有趣的部分，就是它為了讓使用傳統滑鼠的人也能輕易上手，特地設計了模擬滑鼠滾輪的咖啦咖啦聲音跟震動，雖然造型看起來不像傳統滑鼠，但還是可以讓使用者無縫接軌的習慣它；有些朋友喜歡 Arc Mouse 的前衛造型，但不確定自己能不能習慣此種非典型滑鼠，阿輝在這邊可以告訴大家不用擔心這個，輕薄又順手，同時支援多點觸控的操作讓 Surface Laptop 3 使用上更直覺更方便！除了滑鼠之外，一定要介紹手寫筆，Surface 手寫筆也可以說是 Surface 家族重要的存在，幾乎可以說每一台 Surface 機器都強烈建議購買搭配的重要配件！感壓高達 4096 階滑順有手感的筆尖、可以用來選取的側邊按鍵，LED 燈號，還有尾端的橡皮擦，可以說就是最強的內容創作週邊！Surface 手寫筆設計得跟一般筆大小類似，持握感相當不錯，有些手寫筆太粗或太細不好寫，很快就會被束之高閣，但是它握起來跟拿著普通的原子筆差不多，書寫起來手感很好，這點就已經贏一半了，而因為 Surface Laptop 3 是全觸控螢幕，想到什麼就立刻拿筆寫下來，使用上更直覺、方便。手寫筆有許多設計小巧思，其中有個很得阿輝心的就是它的筆身不是全圓形，有一面是平的，這樣可以防止筆放在桌上滾來滾去；大家都知道貓咪會出手撥弄桌上的東西，如果是一般手寫筆或是一般的鉛筆，就會摔到地上，但有一側平面的設計可以防止這種狀況發生。而且跟原廠充電器一樣，Surface 手寫筆還有磁吸功能可以直接吸附在 Surface Laptop 3 側面，不用擔心外出使用筆電時手寫筆容易不見，只要吸附在筆電上就可以了；不只不易弄丟，方便收納，也挺好看的。Surface Laptop 3 搭載觸控螢幕，手寫筆不只能寫，當然也可以用來擔任滑鼠的工作，用手寫筆控制觸控螢幕有一種說不出來的爽感，旁人的筆電螢幕只能看，但 Surface Laptop 3 螢幕可以滑好滑滿，立刻感覺優越了起來。除了能寫，也可以擦，手寫筆的尾端可以當成橡皮擦使用，畫一畫失敗了，可以像使用小天使鉛筆一樣，翻過來就能把畫錯的地方擦掉，非常非常方便，也很適合有在使用電腦繪圖的朋友使用，便利度好畫度直逼一般的畫筆。不過除了當做畫筆之外，也可以當做 PPT 簡報筆，用來控制簡報，在會議上超級好用，不用帶一支手寫筆還要另外再帶簡報筆。不只如此，手寫筆也可以設定快捷鍵，配合不同的工作習慣提供不同的協助。比方說常常需要擷取螢幕的偵探界人士，就可以將手寫筆尾端的按鍵設定為螢幕剪取，只要對著螢幕想剪取的地方按下就能剪取螢幕。而且手寫筆使用電池，大約一兩年換一次即可，續航力相當不錯。滑鼠跟吸附在電腦上的手寫筆擺在一起，就是書桌上最美的風景。除了滑鼠跟手寫筆之外，還可以加購擴充基座，不只可以擴充還可直接替筆電充電，這基本上是阿輝一定會選購的配件，不只能更靈活運用，想接什麼就接什麼甚至連外接螢幕也沒問題，造型也相當出色，與筆電很有整體性。擴充基座是連接充電埠，不會占去一個 USB 連接埠，畢竟都是為了『擴充』了，當然最好不要為了擴充反而減少一個接口，這種小小的體貼也是 Surface Laptop 3 設計巧思。除了增加好幾個 USB-A 接口之外，乙太網路或揚聲器這種比較少見的配備也都附上。全部配件都放在一起只有一個帥字，從擴充機座、觸控筆到滑鼠都是一樣的色系，充滿都會型男的冷硬氛圍，只能說這一組放在桌上，帥度直接 +50。Surface Laptop 3 除了在外型跟性能上的表現都不錯之外，最讓人推崇的就是許多隱含在看似正常配件裡的小巧思，如兩側的各種連接埠，基本上囊括了 USB-A、B、C 等，所有可能會使用的接頭，不管想要連接什麼線都不太需要再外接設備就能直接使用。左側是標準 USB 3.0 Type-A 高速連接埠、一個 USB-C 連接埠以及 3.5mm 耳機/麥克風複合端子插孔。右側則是電源孔，並且是延續以往優質的磁吸式設計。很多朋友習慣使用 Mac 筆電，但是許多朋友總是有一些抱怨，最主要因為 Mac 為了讓整體造型更洗煉單純所以只留下 USB-C 的接口實在太激進了，以阿輝的多樣化工作型態來說形同地獄，在各種資料的傳輸之間 USB-A 絕對是不可或缺的，只用 Mac 等於就是要有隨身攜帶擴充設備的覺悟了，以便利為主要性質的筆電當然是需要的物件越少越好，不是嗎？為了刪減不同的接口，反而需要增加額外的裝置，不是有點本末倒置嗎？總之，Surface Laptop 3 就考量了這點，留下該留的優勢。不過，就算連接埠不夠，也可以選購剛剛上面提到的擴充基座。而原廠的充電線不只小巧便攜，即使帶著出門也不會增加太多負擔；雖然線材跟變壓器不能分開，但是體積小容易收納，這點小小缺點也就不重要了。除此之外，上面竟然有設計一個 USB-A 接頭，等於是多一個豆腐頭，沒帶豆腐頭只帶線的朋友，手機沒電時也可以直接用 Surface Laptop 3 來充電，這個設計非常聰明而且相當實用，想像一下，咖啡廳中鄰座的美女正在發愁只有帶到充電線但沒帶豆腐頭時，你可以優雅有禮又紳士地邀請她靠過來一些使用 Surface Laptop 3 充電。這個設計不只拉近人與人的距離、搭訕更方便，就算對孤家寡人的單身漢來說也非常實用。原廠的充電埠特規，基本上只有 Surface Laptop 能用，磁吸的設計相當安全，以往 Mac 也是磁吸充電，阿輝本來對此相當推崇，但不知道為什麼改掉了，幸好 Surface Laptop 3 依舊保留這個優點，就算不小心踢到充電線也不用擔心整台電腦滑落；造型也與筆電相當有一致性，單看充電線也相當優雅細緻。或許有人會問，使用特規連接埠充電，那萬一沒帶到充電線不是假賽嗎？這個問題在很多廠牌的筆電都會發生，不過 Surface Laptop 3 提供了很出色的解決方案──可以使用 USB-C 連接埠充電。就是即便沒帶到線，只要找到一條 TYPE-C 的線就能充電，甚至支援 PD 充電的行動電源都可以替 Surface Laptop 3 充電！這個設計也就是說，Surface Laptop 3 不管是左側還是右側都有可以用以充電的連接埠，不過使用原廠充電線的話有磁吸功能，而使用 USB-C 就沒有了。除了外在結構上的各種小設計讓人稱許之外，還有一直都很得阿輝的心的生物辨識（對！阿輝就是懶惰！科技進步就是來自於惰性！），只要設定完成之後，幾乎可以說是一掀開螢幕就立即解鎖，超級方便；Windows Hello 的一秒解鎖便利度，非常適合阿輝這種懶惰得甚至不太想伸手去使用指紋解鎖，更遑論鍵入密碼的人。基本上 Surface Laptop 3 就是靠著 720p HD f/2.0 的前置相機，因為製作得比較廣角，來運作 Windows Hello 臉部辨識系統非常適合，只要一打開螢幕就能立刻掃描，那個速度差不多就是一開就能直接使用，方便到爆。而且 Windows Hello 功能設定超簡單，只要進入設定後按照步驟進行，就可以輕鬆設定完成。不過在設定的時候需要一直緊盯相機，等待系統掃描臉部完成。而且 Surface Laptop 3 也有內建白板功能，在疫情蔓延的現在可以在視訊會議中使用更適合，兼具便利性、實用與趣味性；使用上非常容易，只要開啟白板，就可以自由地使用。白板可以自己決定筆刷類型與粗細，愛用什麼筆就用什麼筆，當然也可以挑選顏色。手殘的朋友也不用擔心，隨便畫一個形狀，再歪七扭八系統都會協助導正──不然阿輝怎麼可能畫得出這麼工整的幾何圖形。可以使用畫圖的方式直接建立圖形跟表格，不管畫得圓圈多歪七扭八，只要辨識得出是圓形，螢幕就會出現一個完整精美的圓。也可以匯出匯入圖片，像是網路上參考一些範本來編輯，或是直接開啟相機拍攝照片放置到白板中。 還可以擷取影像，然後留下像是筆跡速寫圖案的描繪痕跡。這功能不能說非常實用大家都會用到，但就是還頗有趣的。白板當然還有記事本的功能，同樣可以像一般記事本一樣分類記錄。白板功能還有很多實用與趣味兼具的有意思功能，還等著使用者去發掘更多創意用法，協助大家以更有效率的方式完成工作，或至少顧及工作上的趣味性，用心情比較愉快的方式進行冗長繁雜的工作；俗話說得好，工作的心情影響效率，為了能好好偷懶阿輝會非常認真……沒有這句俗話。Surface Laptop 3 有著時尚俐落、簡約洗煉，同時適合都會型男與事業成功 OL 剛柔並濟的外型，能滿足品味出眾的社會精英。此外，還有略帶剛毅的有稜有角形狀跟超薄輕量優勢，是一台 13.5 吋小巧的小型筆電卻有著比尺寸類似它牌筆電更大的 Corning Gorilla Glass 3 螢幕，抗刮耐磨又鮮豔多彩，同時有能滿足商務、工作、視聽娛樂與輕遊戲的效能還有長效的續航力；並且有各種小巧思來滿足使用者，提升工作效率之外顧及攜帶與收納的便利性，更強化筆電的方便性同時又沒有忽略整體使用體驗，外在與結構、配件上的優勢配合各種軟體上的巧思，該具備的無一不缺，又能額外添購前衛有質感的 Arc Mouse、Surface Pen 還有擴充基座更完整筆電的使用體驗，便利使用者。如果您在找一台能應付工作、娛樂使用，同時又很在乎外型精緻與否跟攜帶便利性，並對於周邊擴充配件的美感、設計與便利度實用性要求標準高，且需要能穩定使用長效續航的美型 13.5 吋觸控螢幕筆電，那只能說不管是只求文書作業順暢的自由工作者或是對效能有追求的商務工作者，或是需要時時刻刻發揮創意的專業人士都很適合的 Surface Laptop 3，或許就是您命中註定的那一台筆電。標籤： 商業合作廖阿輝阿輝目前是自由撰稿工作者 + 全職攝影師 + 社群網站經營，本身 IT 與資訊背景經驗約 10 年，也有在平面與網路媒體撰稿，文章撰寫著重技術內容為主，並以專業等級產品拍攝撰文，目前也是台灣科技新聞節目常採訪的專家 / 來賓。這個網站採用 Akismet 服務減少垃圾留言。進一步瞭解 Akismet

    "https://www.techradar.com/news/this-unannounced-and-super-cheap-asus-laptop-comes-with-an-exciting-unique-feature": "\nBy\nDesire Athow\n24 April 2020\nAsus delivers a fanless design and standout aesthetic.At first, we thought there had been some sort of mistake, but the new Asus ImagineBook really is available for $299.99 from BestBuy (about £245/AU$480), in what looks to be a global exclusive.Asus ImagineBook laptop - $299.99 at BestBuy\n(roughly £245/AU$480)\nInexplicably affordable, this new Asus notebook rocks an Intel Core M3 CPU, two cores, and a standout aesthetic. It's also virtually silent thanks to its fanless design. Grab it while you can!\nView DealThis new piece of kit from Asus hasn't even been announced at the time of writing, and we're excited about it for a number of reasons. Chief among them, the presence of the Intel Core M3-8100Y CPU.This processor is usually reserved for much more expensive, premium laptops. Intel itself says the CPU has a suggested retail price of $355, far higher than the price of the whole ImagineBook.Asus has also adopted a design philosophy that reminds us of the netbook era; textured lid, a pure white minimalist finish, fine-mesh-texturing around the keyboard and an abundance of plastic (and not the tacky type).Unfortunately, BestBuy does not deliver globally, so international customers may have to use a specialist parcel forwarding service if they want to take advantage of the deal.The device features two cores, a power dissipation of only 5W and a maximum Turbo frequency of 3.4GHz (up from 1.1GHz). Such a low TDP means the system can forgo the fan and rely solely on the heatsink, making for a beautifully quiet experience.The hardware components are admittedly unspectacular (4GB RAM and 128GB SSD), but with a 14-inch TN full HD matte panel, 802.11ac and a decent array of ports (audio jack, three USB ports, an HDMI connector and a microSD slot), the ImagineBook should cater to most use cases.Have you managed to get hold of a cheaper product with equivalent specifications, in stock and brand new? Let us know and we'll tip our hat to you.It's bigger and heavier than we’d expect and there are reports the memory is soldered (so you won’t be able to upgrade it), but the SSD and the Wi-Fi card can be swapped out.We have a hunch stocks won't last, so pick it up while you can!Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

But you shouldn't count on it if you want to maximize their usable lifespan.Pro tip: If people refuse to touch your laptop without PPE, that's probably a sign it needs to be cleaned. When you need to touch someone else's grody laptop and don't want to waste disposable protective gloves, you might try putting a sheet of cling wrap between your fingers and the keyboard.Whether you need to delay a new laptop purchase because of uncertain finances (to put it mildly), want to reduce your contribution to the e-waste problem or simply have more important things to think about, there's a lot you can do to stretch the lifespan of your existing system.The longevity horizon of a laptop is analogous to the longevity of a human: It partly comes down to responsible behavior, partly genetics and partly just dumb luck. There's no guarantee that anything you do can save it from dying young or failing to keep up with increasingly demanding tasks. And there's no guarantee that if you treat it like crap it won't last far longer than expected -- in 10 years you might find yourself cursing it. \"Fail already you slow POS so I can justify buying a replacement!\" That's the argument I have daily with my 7-year old iPad ($460 at QVC).I kept on using it, thinking the trackpad was just going bad, until it popped out completely and I realized the battery beneath it had swollen. Ah, the joys of the early ultrathin models! (This is a 2013 Samsung ATIV Book 9.)It baffles me, for instance, that my friend's 5-plus-year-old Lenovo Yoga 2 13 still functions, and actually functions well. It's filthy, it's been knocked off precarious perches by flying cats, it sits baking in hot sunlight, endures summers with 90% humidity indoors, and its operating system hasn't been updated in... I don't think ever. She still hasn't filled up the 128GB drive. Yet, in the interim, I've gone through at least two laptops, one with a battery that swelled up and another with a wiring and broken plastic issue that rendered the display unusable. They exited in close to pristine aesthetic condition.Data backup is on my long, long list of \"do as I say, not as I do\" advice. But the longer you hold onto a laptop, the more irreplaceable files and information you'll accumulate on it. And the greater the chance it'll crumble into e-waste. So before you touch your laptop it to address any issues -- including cleaning -- you want to make a backup.The unwritten rule is this: If you don't back up your laptop, it will experience a catastrophic failure. But if you do, then nothing will happen. Because that's the way the universe works.No. Just no.I don't mean sing it a lullaby before you put it to sleep every night, or even treat it gingerly. Just use some common sense when it comes to handling and storage. For example, don't think \"Awww, cute. Instagram it!\" when your cat curls up on your laptop keyboard seeking attention or warmth. Think \"That cat is going to annihilate my MacBook's butterfly keyboard.\" Other simple practices include:You should also check the adapter cable periodically, especially if you've got pets. Run your fingers along it feeling for teeth marks. A chewed-through cable won't ruin your laptop -- they're designed to stop working if the insulation is punctured -- but it can get expensive replacing them. My cat, Iris the Destroyer, earned her name by chewing through two Dell AC adapters at $70 a pop (among other reasons). If you catch it early, you can reroute them for safety. Plus, it's not good for them.It's easy to ignore basic maintenance, especially if you use your laptop every day. You just stop noticing the crud after a while. But periodically taking a minute to examine entry points around keycaps, the keyboard surface, touchpad surface, speaker grilles, hinge, ports, vents and screen may save you some heartache (and money) in the long run. Even if none of it poses a long-term health issue for your system, you don't want to wait until detritus builds up so much that it's almost impossible to get out or off. Keeping the fan vents clear and dust-free is especially important. Every now and then, take a pass through applications and files, as well as programs and services that run at startup, and jettison anything you don't need. Will doing that extend the life of the system? Probably not, except perhaps by reducing a fractional amount of heat generated by unnecessary processor activity. But at the very least, periodically weeding it can make it feel faster, just like cleaning out a room can make it feel bigger. And at best you will experience some real performance improvements, including improved battery life. It may also turn out that you don't need the memory or storage upgrades that you thought you did. At some point, you'll probably feel like the incremental approach isn't working for you anymore. Then it's time to consider wiping it off and starting from scratch: You'll need to reinstall the same version of the operating system and applications. This can be trickier, since it may require repurchasing old programs, recustomizing every aspect of the operating system or application behavior, debugging system glitches again and more. Plus, you run the risk of breaking something that was working fine before. That's software. What about hardware? Aside from upgrades, a laptop's hardware remains pretty static. There's no magic wand to wave will make your trackpad feel five years younger. One exception is battery life: Changing your software settings can make a big difference to the battery's longevity.A powered, external hub can greatly expand the usability of an older system as well as reduce wear and tear on the connections.Using accessories such as an external keyboard, mouse or monitor -- even cheap ones -- may help save wear and tear on the built-in components and hinge. More important, once those components of a laptop start to get wonky, the system itself will still be usable if you can find external replacements for the devices.If you're constantly moving between desktop locations, it's worth getting a dock or hub for those external devices. This will save wear and tear on the connections from constant plugging and unplugging. It also adds extra ports, which is another perk that will extend the useful life of your laptop.Because real upgrades always require some expense, this is probably one of the final steps you'll consider. But small, incremental upgrades can make a big difference. Not as many laptops support internal memory or storage upgrades as they used to -- replaceable batteries even less so -- but if you can, you should definitely take advantage of the option as you start to hit limits. That's one of the advantages of hanging onto an older laptop -- it's more likely to be upgradable. That's as long as you feel comfortable opening it up to stick things in. Before you start down this path, make sure to find an upgrade or maintenance guide for your particular system to verify that it supports your plan. You should also check that it doesn't require expensive nonstandard components, which will cost more than it's worth.When I bought this inexpensive Asus UL30 in 2009, it was partly for its upgradability and removable battery. The display failed before I even got a chance to take advantage of that. (It was probably fixable, but wasn't worth it given the price.)External upgrades can be easier and more practical, though in some cases they don't provide as big a boost. Or they may not make as big a difference as you thought they would. I secretly added a Netgear Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac) USB dongle to a tech-challenged friend's laptop, which was equipped with pokey Wi-Fi 4 (802.11 b/g/n). Speedtest showed that throughput doubled. Given how much time she spends online, that seemed to make it worth the money. She didn't notice any difference.If you're running short on storage, an external drive is an obvious enhancement. Unless you only plan to use it to offload files you don't use often, you may want to avoid going too cheap. A slow external drive can be more annoying than uplifting. You can also potentially improve performance by booting from an external drive, though that depends on the connection and the drive speed.Another possible performance upgrade -- only if you've got a newer laptop with a Thunderbolt 3 connection, though -- is to add an external graphics processor (eGPU) to boost speed in applications or games with heavy GPU usage. This can be a pricey upgrade, though, and the enclosure and the graphics card are frequently sold separately, which can obscure the true cost.You may want to consider moving to a newer version of the operating system if you're not on it already. I don't consider it a no-brainer, though. If you're laptop's crumbling to dust, a newer version of the OS may not unequivocally improve things. And you also run the risk of losing the ability to run some applications. Case in point: The latest version of Mac OS, Catalina (10.15), removed support for 32-bit applications. So if a program hasn't been migrated from 32 to 64 bit -- and there are good reasons why it may not have been -- the upgrade would actually be a step backward for you. Sticking with an outdated version of an operating system is widely considered to be bad hygiene, though, because you don't get the constant barrage of virus, malware and security updates that up-to-date systems receive.And finally, when you're at the end of your rope, you've got nothing to lose by replacing the operating system with something new altogether. If your laptop powers on and at least most of the keys work, there's a good chance it can be converted into a Chromebook, running Google's Chrome OS, to give it at least a little more useful life before it goes to live upstate on a retired laptop farm. Be respectful, keep it civil and stay on topic.

How you want to use your PC outside of work, where you want to take it, what type of display you want, and how powerful you want it to be all play a role in the final decision.Source: Daniel Rubino/Windows CentralAdding a touch display to your work-from-home setup will give you and your workforce an extra way to interact with Windows 10. Touch displays are ideal for design and artwork, and there are plenty of productivity apps designed for touch or input from an active pen.Many standard laptops include at least an upgrade option for a touch display, and convertible or 2-in-1 laptops include a touchscreen due to their ability to change into a tablet. Many AiO PCs also include a touch display as a standard option.If you're leaning toward a standard desktop tower but want a touch display, you'll have to invest in an external touch monitor. You'll pay more for the added feature, but it's certainly an option that you can investigate and can be useful for certain types of users. In most cases, though, look for a laptop or AiO if you're interested in a touch display.Source: Windows CentralIf you'd like to remain unchained from your home office chair, a laptop easily beats out a desktop or AiO. You can take an Ultrabook with you wherever you go, and it should be powerful enough to handle daily productivity work. Even larger, more powerful laptops with dedicated graphics cards (GPUs) are going to be much easier to transport than a desktop or AiO.Add in the fact that some Ultrabooks include 4G LTE connectivity, and you have the ability to take your work with you to the park or just about anywhere else where there's cell service. No need for a Wi-Fi connection.Tired: I'm working from home.Wired: I'm working on top of a mountain.Find the tech that lets you work on your terms😁 Panasonic TOUGHBOOK 55, I still need to review this thing! Coming Soon™https://t.co/UWznC1vUVQ pic.twitter.com/Eb4xRWcPhkThe ability to move around your home of office, working from different rooms (or even the backyard, balcony or parking lot), can do a lot to keep your mind fresh. But if you're more on the side of sitting down in one spot and grinding out your work until it's done, a desktop or AiO shouldn't be an issue.If you're pressed for space, an AiO is likely going to make more sense (at least once you've decided against a laptop). The PC hardware and monitor are, in most cases, built into one piece. There's no desktop tower or separate monitor to find room for in a small office or workspace.Source: Windows CentralFor most people dealing with standard, everyday office work — word processing, web browsing, video streaming, and email — any form of PC will get the job done. If you'd like to branch out and have your PC handle other tasks like design, photo-editing, or gaming, things get a bit more complicated.Sure, laptops can handle pretty much anything these days, but you're going to pay more for the premium. Want to invest in something you can use to unwind with games when the workday is done? In most cases, a gaming laptop with the same level of performance as a desktop is going to cost more. The same applies for AiO PCs.Source: Windows CentralIf you're looking to maximize performance-to-price ratio for whatever reason, a standard desktop should be your first choice. Laptops and AiO PCs are undoubtedly available with impressive specs, but you will end up paying more for the premium.There's also the issue of future upgrades. While a lot of laptops have a removable bottom panel that lets you reach the RAM and hard drive, upgrading beyond that is pretty much a non-starter. If you'd like to buy a PC that you can keep running well into the future with occasional upgrades (including processor (CPU) or GPU), a desktop PC should be your first choice.Source: Daniel Rubino/Windows CentralIf you'd like to remain as mobile as possible while you or your workforce is working from home — think of working from the park or your backyard — a laptop makes the most sense. Especially if you consider a laptop with LTE connectivity. Likewise, if you're interested in a touch display and active pen support, a laptop will be the more affordable option compared to an AiO.Laptops range in price from inexpensive to outrageous. Still, we've put together a collection of the best overall Windows laptops available today to help you pick what's right.If you're instead searching out the best price-to-performance ratio, or more room for upgrades and hardware replacements down the line, a desktop PC should be at the top of your list. There are plenty of affordable desktops available with rather impressive specs, and in most cases, all you need to do is add a monitor. Desktop PCs are also generally easier to upgrade, making them a better choice for anyone who wants their device to last well into the future.Finally, AiO PCs are a bit of a mixed bag. In many cases they provide the option for a touch display, they take up less space than a standard desktop PC, and they're available with some pretty powerful hardware. You don't have to worry about picking out a separate monitor, though you are stuck with the same display. And in most cases, you can't upgrade hardware.Worth every pennyThe latest XPS 13 features a taller 16:10 display, 10th-Gen Intel processor with all-day battery life, and a design unmatched by any other PC on the market.

Still, buying an MSI Alpha 15 laptop for $799 will net you an AMD Ryzen 7 3750H and an AMD Radeon RX 5500M at a price point well below the best gaming laptops and many others.  MSI Alpha 15: was $999, now $799 at Newegg \nThe MSI Alpha 15 is a mid-range, all-AMD laptop that puts a primary focus on comfort and affordability. Its high frame rate display offers bright colors, and its SteelSeries keyboard is clicky and bouncy, as per our MSI Alpha 15 review. While performance is decidedly mid-range, a mig-range laptop for $799 is nonetheless impressive.  Our MSI Alpha 15 review also praised the machine's colorful display and comfortable keyboard, while acknowledging that “If you’re an AMD-only type user, this is for you. There’s nothing else like it in the space.” While performance was mid-range for its then-$1,099 price tag, that same power for $799 is tempting.MSI recently announced the follow-up to the Alpha 15, the Bravo 15, which is also available for pre-order on Newegg right now with a release window set for early next month.
