Do whatever you want if it’s a robot. Lots of husbands are pretty much robots anyway. Do what you need to do.’What if it’s a robot that looks just like your partner?‘Nope. Do what makes you happy.’And if it’s a robot that looks just like your partner, but from 20 years ago?‘Ah. I see where you’re going.

    "https://www.itproportal.com/features/the-myth-of-the-secure-fax-machine/": "\nBy\nScott Wilson\n06 April 2020\nFax machines remain a hidden security issue in many businesses.Technology has fundamentally changed the way all organisations operate and communicate, with the speed of information sharing almost instantaneous. While private sector businesses are free to rip and replace technology systems at will, public sector organisations are slower on the uptake thanks to restricted budgets. The NHS is most frequently lambasted for its use of older technology and in 2018 Health Secretary Matt Hancock criticised the health service for its continued use of fax machines, prohibiting any use of the devices from the end of March 2020. When announcing the ban, Hancock claimed fax machines were ‘archaic’ and that ‘everyone else had got rid of them years ago’. That isn’t, however, entirely true.A recent freedom of information request found that almost a thousand fax machines are known to be in use across local councils, fire services, police stations and universities in the UK, with more than 125,000 faxes sent and received across these organisations in 2019. And it isn’t just the public sector. While faxing may seem like a communication method of a bygone era, in reality nearly 17 billion faxes are sent around the world every year. Many believe that fax machines are more secure than more modern forms of communication – in fact, Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton revealed that, after the infamous hack in 2014, he had taken to sharing sensitive information via fax – but the technology is old and that does not equate to security.While fax machines are analogue and therefore not at risk from the same hacking techniques as digital technology, that does not mean they are immune. In fact, the very thing that protects them from modern forms of data exfiltration is what makes them vulnerable. Often, a belief that fax machines are secure comes from the fact they cannot be accessed remotely, unlike digital communication tools. However, this doesn’t automatically equate to privacy and protection. While in transit, fax documents are not encrypted which means anyone who can access the phone line can, theoretically, can also access information sent via the fax machine.While the vast majority of organisations are unlikely to suffer an attack targeted enough to hack their phone lines, the lack of encryption presents a major flaw that will impact every single organisation using fax machines. They produce paper documents. Fax machines are often communal, positioned in the middle of the office and easily accessed by anyone who passes the machine. As soon as the fax is printed, unless the intended recipient is waiting at the machine, it can be seen and picked up by any passer-by. There’s then the issue of misplacing any paper documents. There are countless examples of pieces of paper containing highly confidential and sensitive information going missing or being stolen. Paper is simply an analogue data breach waiting to happen.According to Verizon’s 2019 Data Breach Investigations Report, 35 per cent of all data breaches are caused by human error – an issue fax machines are hugely prone to. It is all too easy for users to type the wrong number into a fax machine and just one incorrect digit can lead to disaster. Last year it was revealed that a number of faxes containing patient prescription information had been sent to a hotel group inadvertently. While all forms of communication are prone to human error, faxing is extremely prone to the ‘fat finger’ problem thanks to the sheer number of mistakes that can easily be made when dialling a phone number.On top of these data privacy issues, fax machines are decades-old technology and were never built to deal with modern security threats. While in previous incarnations fax machines were only connected to phone lines, these days the rise of multi-functional devices (MFDs) means they are now often hooked up to the wider business systems to allow, for example, printing over WiFi. While the complexities of the different vulnerabilities that fax machines face are myriad, the basic issue is that technology has evolved beyond them making it even easier for attackers to exploit their archaic practices to gain access to wider business systems. A vulnerability discovered by security company CheckPoint discovered, for example, allowed hackers to exploit flaws in the communication protocols of millions of MFDs and share malware-infected image files, with that malware then spreading to other connected devices. Despite these inherent security risks, faxing as a method of communication is unlikely to disappear any time soon. For many, the reliance on faxing – especially in highly regulated industries like healthcare and finance – makes it almost impossible to do away with the technology altogether. And, fortunately, the approach doesn’t have to be that extreme.Cloud technologies have enabled organisations to transform their IT infrastructure – from getting rid of their server room and back-up tapes to allowing increased collaboration across borders – and the fax machine has been long overdue the same treatment. The security concerns, plus inflexibility of the fax machine given it is inherently not mobile, means we are now seeing a rise in cloud faxing. Cloud faxing allows the entire fax process to be handled digitally via the web; either through a company’s email application, a multifunctional device, workflow application, mobile app or secure web-portal. This provides users with a huge amount of flexibility as they are no longer tied to a physical fax machine and faxes can be sent from and to any device – whether the person you are communicating with uses fax machines or not. For example, if a supplier asks for orders to be submitted via fax, I can photo the order on my mobile phone, access the cloud faxing app and send the order to my supplier’s fax machine.Not only does this make faxing hugely more accessible, but it also increases security. Cloud faxes are sent over the internet, via encrypted channels meaning they cannot be accessed by anyone else and faxes in storage are also encrypted for security and compliance.  Delivery confirmations provide a clear audit trail of everything that was sent or received and when, which provides reassurance information is shared with who it was intended for.What’s more, cloud faxing provides a level of control for the organisation that traditional fax machines just can’t afford – even if they are kept in a locked room – by allowing admins to develop permissions and restrictions to ensure that only those authorised to send and receive faxes do so.Fax machines are a hidden problem – but they are a big one. We know the public sector are prolific users, especially the NHS, and instead of insisting a complete policy shift in the way those using faxes communicate, there needs to simply be a more modern solution in use.Cloud faxing enables organisations to maintain all of the benefits of fax, without the need for cumbersome machines or paper records and with increased security, privacy and compliance. Everything else has moved to the cloud, it’s time for the fax to follow suit.Scott Wilson, Director of Sales and Service, eFaxSign up below to get the latest from ITProPortal, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!ITProPortal is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

    "https://www.techradar.com/reviews/faxcom": "\n\n \n\n\nBy\nAlex McOmie\n17 April 2020\nFax.com only offers a single subscription for 300 pages per month, so it’s only a viable option for businesses with specific fax needs. Even if Fax.com fits your company’s scale, other services provide better features and value.While fax machines were once the only way to send and receive faxes, online fax services are an increasingly popular option for both small and large businesses. The best online fax services make it easy to view and send faxes from a variety of devices.In our Fax.com review, we discovered that this online fax service is a decent option for smaller companies but doesn’t provide the same scalability as some competitors. Read on to learn more about its pros and cons and to determine whether it’s the best option for your company.Fax.com only offers one subscription. For $9.99 per month, you’ll be able to send and receive a total of up to 300 pages. Additional pages cost 12 cents each, but you will be charged more if the page takes longer than 60 seconds to send. The service also charges a one-time setup fee of $9.99, which is due when you start a new subscription.The monthly fee covers all incoming faxes along with faxes sent within the US and Canada. International faxes are subject to an additional charge depending on the destination. You can view pricing by country on the Fax.com website.With Fax.com, you can send faxes via email or through the website. When using the website, you can also add custom headers and cover pages, store contacts, view previous faxes, and more. The service offers both local and toll-free numbers depending on your needs.Unfortunately, email and the website are the only two ways to send faxes. There’s no Android or iOS app, and the platform doesn’t integrate with other productivity tools.That said, Fax.com advertises that it offers free online storage for up to 30 days. After you log in, the website states that storing documents for longer “may incur a monthly storage fee based on your current plan,” but Fax.com only offers one plan. Furthermore, the pricing page claims that long-term storage costs “$0.00 per fax per month.” This seems to imply that storage is free over the long term and not just for 30 days.During the setup process, Fax.com will ask for basic information including your name, email address, and phone number. You’ll also have a chance to select your new fax number. Fax.com requires a credit card, even if you’re signing up for a free trial (available for 30 days).Once you’ve created an account, you’ll be able to start sending faxes. The process only takes a few minutes. After signing up, you can adjust preferences at any time under the Settings tab.While Fax.plus provides decent features for sending faxes online, its interface is surprisingly unintuitive. Furthermore, there’s no mobile app, and the website doesn’t display particularly well on smartphones and tablets. With that in mind, it’s easier to send faxes via email rather than the website.In general, faxes should be delivered to their destination within one minute per page. Unfortunately, Fax.com starts counting a page multiple times if it takes more than one minute to send. Delays are usually caused by a poor internet connection or overly complicated documents.The Fax.com Support Center provides a basic guide to using the website. If you run into any problems with the platform, access the Support Center by clicking Help in the upper-right corner. The FAQ includes additional information about the site, along with a guide to sending faxes via email.If you don’t find what you’re looking for, you can also create a ticket through the Support Center. That said, the website doesn’t list any support hours or turnaround times, and there’s no live phone or chat support.Fax.com is a relatively secure way to send and receive faxes, with documents only available to the sender and recipient. Faxes sent through the website are SSL-encrypted, while documents sent through email are secured by your email client.On the other hand, Fax.com doesn’t support two-factor authentication, one of the simplest ways to increase account security. There’s also no way to set up single sign-on—users have to sign into a Fax.com account to access the website.If you’re concerned about pricing, Fax.com isn’t the most affordable option. The SRFax Standard Lite plan, for example, provides up to 500 total pages per month for $9.95—almost identical to the cost of a Fax.com subscription. If you need more than 500 pages, extra pages are just six cents each (compared to 12 on Fax.com).Additionally, SRFax comes with several key features that aren’t available at Fax.com. Users can schedule faxes to send at a specific time, access unlimited lifetime storage, and integrate the tool with other programs through the SRFax API.While Fax.com gets the job done if you need to send or receive faxes without a fax machine, it also comes with a number of downsides. First, there’s only one plan, so users who want to send and receive more than 300 pages per month will have to pay 12 cents for each additional page.Furthermore, Fax.com has a poor web interface and no mobile app. You will be charged more for faxes that take more than 60 seconds to send, and there’s no way to tell in advance how long it will take. All things considered, there are better options out there if you’re looking for an online fax service.Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!Thank you for signing up to TechRadar.

With most of its employees working from home — and unable to retrieve the mail — the agency is asking companies that normally must file forms on paper to fax them. That’s how the agency intends to implement a key business provision in the coronavirus stimulus response, our Aaron Lorenzo reports. That legislation liberalized so-called net operating loss rules, which allow companies to apply for quickie tax returns. It’s a time-tested way of getting money fast to cash-strapped businesses. The problem was those forms, until now, had to be filed on paper.It’s not the first time the IRS is turning to faxes in the wake of coronavirus. It previously asked companies to fax the form needed to claim new tax breaks for keeping workers on the rolls, and also for offering family and medical leave. Meanwhile, the mail is piling up at the IRS. “There is so much mail that the post office can’t hold it so we are literally holding it in trailers until our employees can get back,” Sunita Lough, deputy commissioner for enforcement, said Monday at a webcast panel sponsored by the Tax Policy Center. Not everyone can turn to the fax, though — if you’ve filed your own individual tax return the old-fashioned way, and it hasn’t already been processed, you’re out of luck. “Paper returns will be processed once processing centers are able to reopen,” the IRS said. THE CORONAVIRUS & THE UK: JOIN TODAY TO HEAR FROM THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR: The coronavirus hit Britain hard, with the fourth-highest death toll in Europe and a stay in the ICU for the country’s prime minister. Join Global Translations author Ryan Heath today at 2:30 p.m. EDT for a virtual discussion with Dame Karen Pierce, who was named Britain’s ambassador to the United States in February. Pierce will detail the government's handling of the pandemic, the status of the “special relationship\" between the United Kingdom and the United States, and what it’s like to be an ambassador in quarantine. Have questions? They’ll answer as many as they can. REGISTER HERE TO PARTICIPATE.IRS LOOKING KINDLY ON TAXPAYERS: The agency has been issuing some taxpayer-friendly interpretations of the latest coronavirus stimulus measure. It has said, for example, that businesses can participate in the new Paycheck Protection Program and also take advantage of new provisions allowing them to defer payroll taxes, under certain conditions. That had been in question because both initiatives were designed to do the same thing: subsidize companies that keep workers on. Tapping both, for companies, could amount to double dipping. And the law includes rules against having loans forgiven under the paycheck program while also deferring payroll taxes. Some figured the IRS would make businesses choose between the two. Instead, the agency said they can take advantage of both up until the point at which they have any loans forgiven — then the deferral ends. “Treasury gave out some pretty darn favorable taxpayer-friendly guidance here,” said Rick Grafmeyer, a lobbyist at Capitol Tax Partners.The agency also extended a slew of deadlines, including some that were easy to miss. Among them: The IRS is giving people more time to complete like-kind exchanges, a priority for the real estate industry. The agency also extended a deadline for people to roll over capital gains into Opportunity Zone funds. “On behalf of 1.4 million realtors across the United States, I want to commend the IRS for moving quickly,” said Vince Malta, president of the National Association of Realtors.And about that guidance: The IRS has churned out a mountain of guidance filling in the blanks of the stimulus package. One reason it's been able to do so much, so quickly: The agency is emphasizing FAQs instead of traditional regulations. It’s much faster to write a list of questions and answers about the legislation than writing regulations that must be put out for public comment and revised. But one question going forward will be how well this less formal guidance stands up in court, where judges have given far more weight to traditional regulations. 80 MILLION STIMULUS PAYMENTS ON THEIR WAY: Lough said the IRS hit send on the first batch of payments on Friday, and that people who had direct deposit information on file with the agency should have already started seeing the money. Within the next two weeks, the Treasury Department said, most will have received their payments. One lingering question still facing the IRS: How do deal with people on supplemental security income, which provides monthly benefits to low-income elderly and disabled people. Many do not file tax returns because they earn so little, and some don’t receive Social Security benefits either. (The IRS says it can use Social Security statements to process payments.) A challenge there, Lough said, is dependents: “Are they dependents of somebody else’s return? Do they have dependents? It’s an item of conversation daily.”CORONAVIRUS NOT STOPPING THE SUPREME COURT: After postponing hearings because of the coronavirus, the high court announced it will hold hearing next month via telephone. Among the cases the justices will hear: Democrats’ demands for President Donald Trump’s financial records. Their suits seeking documents from his accounting firm Mazars as well as his bankers at Deutsche Bank will be heard sometime between May 4 and May 13, POLITICO's Josh Gerstein reports. (House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal’s suit for Trump’s federal returns is still on hold in a D.C. district court.)POLITICO Pro Covid-19 Coverage: We are sharing our top Covid-19 coverage in front of the POLITICO Pro paywall in order to help you stay ahead of rapid shifts in public policy as the federal, state and local governments adapt and coordinate responses.

    "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/nyregion/coronavirus-ny-unemployment-benefits.html": "AdvertisementThousands of newly unemployed New Yorkers desperate to stay afloat are being frustrated by the state’s 1970s-era technology.By Patrick McGeehanMohammed Saiful Islam got a taste of how antiquated the technology that runs New York State’s unemployment-insurance system is when he had to go to a Staples store in the middle of a pandemic to fax his pay stubs to Albany.Mr. Islam, a Lyft driver who lives in Queens and has been idled by the outbreak, is among more than 450,000 New Yorkers who have tried, often in vain, to apply for unemployment benefits in the past three weeks.As he and many others discovered, the state’s archaic systems were woefully unprepared for the deluge of claims. In Mr. Islam’s case, he said it took him four days to reach someone who could explain what he had to do to complete the application process.State officials admitted as recently as last summer that there were problems with the technology used for such applications, describing New York’s unemployment-insurance systems as relics from the heyday of mainframe computers.The software programs that run the systems were “written in the 1970s and 1980s and remain constrained by the technology of that era,” officials wrote while seeking bids as part of a planned modernization project.In March, when hundreds of thousands of workers whose jobs had suddenly evaporated started trying to log onto the Labor Department website or call its phone lines, the systems failed.Would-be applicants’ frustration grew as their computer screens froze repeatedly and their calls went unanswered for days. Some attempts to apply for benefits yielded a pop-up message that suggested using Netscape, a browser that effectively no longer exists.Mr. Islam, who had never applied for jobless benefits in the 35 years since he immigrated from Bangladesh, said he was taken aback to hear that he had to find a fax machine to complete his claim.But he put on a face mask and gloves and warily trudged off to a Staples store. Late this week, he was still waiting to hear how much he would receive, and when.“Scary things are going on in our life right now,” Mr. Islam, 49, said in an interview from the home he shares with his wife and four children.New York’s governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, acknowledged the problems with the unemployment-claims process on Tuesday.“I apologize for the pain,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference. “It must be infuriating to deal with.”The Labor Department, he said, had received 1.2 million calls the day before, after getting more than seven million calls last week. But the state reported just 80,000 claims for the week that ended March 20 and just 370,000 last week, far fewer than either California and Pennsylvania reported.“The staff at the Department of Labor are killing themselves to try to deal with this situation,” said Richard Blum, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society who advocates for worker protections and benefits. “But the problems that they and applicants are facing are the results of long-term disinvestment in the system.”Department officials did not respond to repeated inquiries about the computer systems.New York is not the only state having trouble handling the tidal wave of unemployment claims.On Thursday, the executive director of Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity publicly apologized after the state’s unemployment website failed. Auditors had warned the governor, Ron DeSantis, about problems with the website last year.Connecticut has a backlog that could take five weeks to process because its computer system is also at least 40 years old, said Nancy Steffens, a spokeswoman for the state’s Labor Department.Ms. Steffens said that Connecticut has had to resort to recruiting retirees who knew how to program in COBOL, a nearly extinct computer language. Connecticut and four other states are involved in a joint project meant to overhaul their systems but it will not be finished before next year, she said.New York is not part of that effort. Instead, in 2017, the state sought bids for a “solution” to its unemployment-insurance system. Last year, it awarded a $56 million, five-year contract for that solution to Tata Consultancy Services, which is based in Mumbai.In a subsequent solicitation last July, the state used similar wording to describe its “outdated and expensive mainframe-based” systems, suggesting that the modernization effort would take more time.The repeated crashing of New York’s online application system was a relatively minor setback for Elizabeth Lucia, considering what she has been through lately. Ms. Lucia, who is 30 and several months pregnant, lost two jobs on the same night last month.After Mr. Cuomo ordered nonessential work to stop, she could no longer do either her main job, at the furniture chain Raymour & Flanigan, or her side gig in real-estate sales. Raymour & Flanigan later furloughed her, but the company said it would keep her on its health-insurance plan.Ms. Lucia, who lives in Vestal, N.Y., heard recently that property showings were still allowed, but she decided to stay home anyway.“I need to be healthy to give birth in a month,” she explained.Now, she said, she was counting on unemployment checks to cover her rent and mounting expenses.“I already have a medical bill in the mail for $1,100 that I’m trying to figure out what to do with,” she said, adding that “getting unemployment would be a matter of sinking or swimming.”Navigating the Labor Department’s overloaded system has been a challenge even for tech-savvy applicants like Eric Saari, who said he had once designed mobile apps for IBM.Mr. Saari, 50, said he worried that he might become homeless if he was unable to get unemployment benefits. He had been driving a taxi in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., until early March when a visibly ill passenger wearing a mask said he might have the virus.Mr. Saari quit driving after that and said he was down to his last several hundred dollars, which he needed to buy food for the next month. He has tried seven different websites and the phone numbers of at least three government agencies to try to get help filing a claim, he said.“Right now,” he said, “it’s unfortunately impossible, as far as I can tell.”Congress has promised those who are now unemployed especially generous benefits for the next few months: $600 a week through July, on top of what they would typically get from their home states.But New York residents stand to collect less than recipients in nearby states. The maximum weekly benefit in New York is $504 a week, compared with $631 in Connecticut, $713 in New Jersey and $823 in Massachusetts.“New York’s benefits system is unusually stingy,” said Paul K. Sonn, the state policy program director at the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for low-wage workers. Despite the state’s progressive image, Mr. Sonn said, “New York is not a leading state in providing economic security for jobless workers.”But the $2 trillion stimulus package that Congress approved has made far more people eligible for unemployment benefits, including artists and other freelancers, said Nicole Salk, senior staff attorney at Legal Services N.Y.C.She said she had been counseling some people about how to apply for benefits and avoid pitfalls in the process.New York, she added, also had a distinctly punitive approach when calculating benefits for part-time workers that withholds 25 percent of what they receive in a week for each day they work, no matter how many hours they put in.That means that if an unemployed actress spent just an hour or two a day three days a week delivering groceries for a service like Instacart, she would forfeit 75 percent of her weekly check.The rule, which is inconsistent with how other states handle part-time work, gives unemployed New Yorkers a strong incentive to remain idle while they collect benefits, Ms. Salk said.Legislation to change the rule appeared to have the support of Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders last year, she said, but no bill was ever signed into law.Mr. Blum said he was told why: The Labor Department’s primitive computers could not be reprogrammed quickly enough to make the adjustment.Alex Traub contributed reportingUpdated April 11, 2020This is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: “How will we know when to reopen the country?” In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.The Times Neediest Cases Fund has started a special campaign to help those who have been affected, which accepts donations here. Charity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities. More than 30,000 coronavirus-related GoFundMe fund-raisers have started in the past few weeks. (The sheer number of fund-raisers means more of them are likely to fail to meet their goal, though.)If you’ve been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.The C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don’t need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don’t replace hand washing and social distancing.If you’re sick and you think you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there’s a chance — because of a lack of testing kits or because you’re asymptomatic, for instance — you won’t be able to get tested.It seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.No. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.Unlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions — not just those with respiratory diseases — particularly hard.If the family member doesn’t need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there’s space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don’t forget to wash your hands frequently.Plan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.Yes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don’t live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.That’s not a good idea. Even if you’re retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year’s worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.Watching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions — don’t! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you’re at least saving as much as you can to get that “free money.”Advertisement",

Learn more.\nSource: Windows CentralEven in a world in which people rely on digital tools and books, there's a large place for printed content. The Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx is a laser printer that supports both color and black and white printing. It's also a scanner, copier, and fax machine (!). Over the last several weeks, I've thrown everything I can at the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx to see how it handles a heavy-duty workload.I never realized how much printing our house did until I had a professional-grade printer. All of a sudden, all of my friends and family had bulk printing jobs that I never knew about. This gave me a nice opportunity to test out the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx, even though I don't work in an office anymore. At points of my review, I had four university students printing out notes, slides, and text. I also printed out playbooks and other materials for my American football team. I went through multiple reams of paper during my review and have gone through almost half the ink that shipped with the device. The device I reviewed was a UK version of the printer, although there's a close U.S. equivalent as well.£417$672 (U.S. equivalent)Bottom line: The Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx prints things quickly, clearly, and reliably, but the software can be difficult to work with.Source: Windows CentralBefore I jump into what you'll love and hate about the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx, I have to share my two dramatically different experiences with this printer. Canon sent a review unit well over a month ago, but I've had to extend my review time because things changed so much after a 45-minute video call with Canon support.For the first half of my review, the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx was infuriating. It beeped at me constantly when trying to print things out, and every single job needed me to confirm which tray to print from and what paper size to use. This was baffling to me because only one tray had any paper in it. Why would the printer even ask? Surely it can realize that one tray is full of hundreds of sheets of paper while the other is empty and closed. Apparently not, so I was left manually selecting the tray each time. Similarly, the printer asked for my paper size on every single print job.Now, some of this comes down to user error, though not as much as you'd think. I tried setting the default tray on the actual printer. It has a touch screen that's fairly easy to navigate, and I swapped settings around to change my default tray, or so I thought. I also tried several ways to edit my default page size, including changing settings on the printer and changing settings within apps sending jobs to the printer, all to no avail. At best, things would work for one or two jobs, and then I'd need to do it again for the next job.The actual solutions didn't come until I made a 45-minute video call with a customer support agent who walked me through things. The solution, in my case, was to jump into the remote portal through my web browser. I then had to log in using a passcode he told me over the call. Within the portal, I could then change all sorts of settings that seemed to stick better than adjusting things on the physical device or within print settings within apps. One thing I learned in this process is that this printer can't automatically print standard U.S.-sized Word documents onto A4 paper without manual input. Some other Canon printers support this feature. Either way, the solution that fixed things for good was much more complex than I expected.Once everything got sorted on the software side of things, it was like a completely different printer. Gone were the insistent beeps about paper trays and sizes. After the settings swap, I easily printed large jobs in color or black and white. The printer also supports front and back printing on A4 paper, so you can save paper because it automatically flips sheets over to print on the other side.Source: Windows CentralThe Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx is a laser printer with solid hardware. With that comes some of the key advantages of laser printers, such as fast printing and toner's benefits over ink. This model can print 27 pages per minute, and it hit that mark several times during my testing. It can print in black and white or color as well, which isn't the case with some laser printers. This printer isn't built to do images, but it can handle company logos, graphics, and charts in full color. Printing PDFs of university coursework or printing out contracts for my players all looked great. he quality is easily good enough for printing off briefings and documents for a meeting or for a booth at which you have to pass out a lot of flyers.It can handle up to 250 pages of A4 or smaller paper. It can print A4 pages front and back without you having to reload them, but A5 or other smaller paper sizes require reloading. You can also expand the storage with an optional expansion or use the printer's second tray, which easily handles paper of various sizes.All the basic functions on the printer work well, though I confess I did not test it as a fax machine. The hardware is the side to love on this machine. It works well, handles heavy workloads, and just cranks out large print jobs. I went through several reams of paper during my testing, and the hardware on the device held up great and never slowed down.Source: Windows CentralThe Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx's impressive hardware is held back by its software and user interface. I won't repeat everything around my 45-minute call ordeal, but it's certainly the most frustrating part of this printer. The built-in touch screen allows you to navigate settings and perform tasks, but sometimes you have to edit settings on your PC or in a program to make them work. My main takeaway about the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx's software is that it isn't \"smart\" enough. It needs to be able to identify things on its own and handle everyday essentials without manual input.In an office setting, which is where this printer is meant to go, you want to be able to have all of your employees send jobs to the printer and then go pick them up. There shouldn't be any manual selection needed on the printer, and any settings that do need to be changed should be changeable and work directly on the printer itself.Source: Windows CentralThis is a bit of a difficult question to answer for this printer. I come from the consumer world of printers, such as my budget-friendly HP Envy 5010. I've used some professional-grade printers at previous jobs, but the majority of my printing experience is with basic home printers. I assumed that if you spent around 10 times as much on a printer that it would do everything the cheaper one could and much more.In some ways, the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx delivered a professional experience I'd be happy within an office. It handled print jobs of hundreds of sheets in color and black and white without a hitch on the hardware side. On the hardware side of things, the printer earns high marks.On the software side of things, it was a mixed bag when compared to options with friendlier software. Once I got things working, the printer handles things like a champ, but I shouldn't have to jump into a portal with a hidden password to make things work. Now that I know how to dance the dance with the printer, I can make it do what I'd like, but I don't think a device should have this much of a learning curve. Printers like this should just work.Unfortunately, unless Canon improves the software side of things, I can't recommend the Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx. It's brilliant hardware held back by clunky and frustrating software.A solid piece of hardware held back by softwareThe Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx prints things quickly, clearly, and reliably, but the software can be difficult to work with.The Canon i-SENSYS MF746Cx was reviewed on a device provided by the manufacturer.\nWe may earn a commission for purchases using our links.
