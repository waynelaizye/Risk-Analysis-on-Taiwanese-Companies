But two years earlier, he announced that he made a breakthrough on a solid-state battery that could mean the end of internal-combustion cars. Goodenough, now 97, is self-isolating from the coronavirus and working on Nobel-related commitments. But the job of commercializing the potential breakthrough is being carried forward by the public utility Hydro-Québec.\n\n\t\t\t(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\t\tThe utility company has operated a battery research institute since 1967 and has been working with Goodenough since 1996. Goodenough’s previous Nobel-winning lithium metal phosphate technology is licensed via battery companies Murata and A123 to automakers, bus manufacturers, and energy-storage producers around the world.Electrek spoke this week with Karim Zaghib, the general director at the utility’s Center of Excellence in Transportation Electrification and Energy Storage. Zaghib considers lithium iron phosphate chemistry to be Gen 1 of its development of mainstream EV batteries. It’s being utilized by the likes of BYD, CATL, Tesla, and the Bolloré Group — as well as a gazillion portable electronic devices (maybe the one in your hand).But now the utility is working on the latest generation of Goodenough’s new battery technology that could be just as transformative: a ceramic oxide electrolyte. The electrolyte is the medium between cathode and electrode that ions travel across when the battery charges and discharges.John GoodenoughJohn GoodenoughMeanwhile, as the fundamental science is being conducted on the ceramic oxide electrolyte, Hydro-Québec is collaborating with Mercedes-Benz on what Zaghib calls Gen 2, a solid-state lithium metal polymer battery. This is not related to Goodenough’s work. Nonetheless, it shows great promise.Zaghib explains:In the case of solid electrolyte, we use a polymer to decrease the temperature from 80 degrees C to less than 50 degrees C. This is what you call Gen Two.Zaghib told Electrek that Mercedes-Benz, in a 50-50 partner with Hydro Quebec, is designing the cells and modules that use the technology. Because the polymer materials reduce the operating temperature of the electrolyte, the EV battery can substantially increase its energy density while lowering the cost.Zaghib projects that this research could be put into a production battery as early as 2026.However, the big Goodenough-powered breakthrough would not come until Gen 3. Zaghib said:The lithium ion battery today provides 250 watt hours by kilogram. So you can get [an EV with] range around 350 to 400 kilometers (220 to 250 miles). And the lithium ion battery has a liquid electrolyte, which flammable.But if we switch to solid electrolyte, the electrolyte is not flammable so it’s safe. And then by using lithium metal as anode material, we can enhance the energy density by two times. So, we can go to 500 watt hours per kilogram. That would mean range increasing to as much as 800 kilometers (500 miles). And we could target cost down to $100 per kilowatt-hour for the pack.To repeat: a 500-mile EV battery offered at the target price of $100 per kWh.Zaghib said the key is reducing the operating temperature — from 80 degrees C in Gen 1, to 50 degrees C in Gen 2, and finally 25 degrees using Goodenough’s ceramic oxide electrolyte.He sees encouraging signs in the lab but the challenge comes with manufacturing. It’s relatively easy to control a polymer or liquid material to produce an electrolyte material. But the ceramic material is a different story. He said it’s difficult to make an electrolyte film using ceramic material in a film that’s 20 microns or so. And it also has to withstand 1,000 full charging cycles.So the revolutionary breakthrough is coming, but not tomorrow. Zaghib explained:We need a proof of concept that this technology works first. Then we need another three years to scale the technology. After that, we need about five years to find a company to bring these technologies to commercialization. There aren’t any carmakers interested at this stage, because it’s basic science.The open question is, How long it will take between Goodenough’s 2017 announcement about the revolutionary electrolyte, and when we can buy an EV that has ultra-long-range and an affordable battery? The science takes time.Zaghib reminded us how long it took for the Gen 1 lithium iron phosphate to make its way to today’s EVs:We start working on iron phosphate with John in 1996. It took almost 15 years for that technology to become commercially valuable.FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

Motorists are not only throwing cigarette butts on the ground, she said, some are even getting out of their vehicles to urinate on the ground.Chris Brookes also lives near the Outer Battery and can look out to see people coming off the trail.“Once you get past the Outer Battery, there isn’t six feet to pass someone,” said Brookes, who added many of his neighbours are not happy about people on the trails at this time. “People are not obeying the Parks Canada signs.”In a statement issued to The Telegram, Parks Canada said all its site across the country, including Signal Hill and Cape Spear Lighthouse national historic sites, also closed for safety reasons, noting the measures are in keeping with the advice of public health experts.“We are asking all Canadians to work together. We know that many people have a special connection to Signal Hill and Cape Spear Lighthouse and that they are St. John’s icons,” the statement notes.“However, we are implementing these restrictions to protect everyone, especially those who are most at risk. Parks Canada is asking everyone to stay home to protect themselves, their loved ones and the collective community.”Parks Canada has also suspended camping, group activities and events until at least May 31, 2020, but may extend the closures beyond that date. It said anyone considering a visit to a Parks Canada location should cancel their plans, adding that the resumption of services will take time or be incremental.A complete list of Parks Canada closures and the parameters of the closures is available on the Parks Canada’s website (pc.gc.ca) and Parks Canada’s social media channels.Canadians are also encouraged to visit Canada.ca/coronavirus for the latest information on COVID-19 or follow Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, on Twitter (@CPHO_Canada) for up-to-date information.rosie.mullaley@thetelegram.com@TelyRosiewww.facebook.com/rosiemullaleyOn a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to recommend The Telegram?",

Credit: Ivan Kovbasniuk / Shutterstock.In the age of global trade, cross-border trade of commodities and services has resulted in the interdependence of global economies, when a country’s manufacturing industry is dependent on goods and services sourced from international markets.\nThe emergence of Covid-19 has affected the global economy and resulted in significant downtime for major industries. Similar to other industries, the energy storage industry is facing challenges in manufacturing, shipment delays, project development and research and development. \nIn comparison to the renewables industry, the power industry is in its early stages of development and the epidemic is likely to have a limited impact on market growth. Nevertheless, stakeholders involved in the supply chain are facing significant challenges, which exposes the market to risks in the short term.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgoogletag.cmd.push(function()\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t{ googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1515156373818-0'); }\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nChina’s major lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery manufacturers CATL and BYD announced production delays and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who source battery and raw materials from China, are the most vulnerable to the disruptions in the market. \nFew OEMs have managed to procure materials from alternate sources in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, with manufacturers capable of meeting the short-term demand, while others suspended operations. The battery manufacturing industry in China is estimated to witness a shortfall in 25GWh to 30 GWh in capacity in 2020 due to Covid-19-induced market challenges.\nThe supply chain for battery energy storage is highly concentrated with China dominating the production line. The burgeoning production capacity that Chinese manufacturers achieved has been a primary factor in driving down technology prices. Critical battery components are manufactured in China, either by domestic or international manufacturers. \nTo combat the virus transmission, the government imposed provincial travel bans and factory closures, which slowed battery manufacturing in key industrial centres. The resulting supply constraint impacted the global electric vehicle market, the biggest consumer of batteries, and the stationary power storage market. Although manufacturing has restarted, it is likely to take some time before production is ramped up to pre-Covid-19 levels. \nThe challenges that manufacturers are facing in China include the reduction of orders and unfulfilled payments and only those companies that will overcome these hurdles are likely to survive. Large battery manufacturers face the prospect of a reduction in orders and small manufacturers could see their market share and revenues decline as larger players are likely to realigning their customer base to generate enough cash flow by acquiring a share of the small manufacturers’ consumer base.\nThe Covid-19 outbreak has moved towards demand markets such as the US and Europe, impacting all business verticals from retailing to project commissioning. Companies will find it difficult to engage in business development activities due to quarantine measures and forced changes in daily operations. Many small and medium-sized companies, who rely significantly on their storage business revenues, are vulnerable and likely to be severely affected in the short term.\nLarge projects are likely to face financing and permitting constraints, where restrictions will impact the flow of labour and materials for assembly and testing and commissioning of battery systems. With the economy slowing, a drop in the demand for battery storage is expected, particularly in the residential and commercial sectors, which is likely to spread upstream as well.\nWith the pandemic going global, logistics are another risk emerging for battery manufacturers. Countries integral for the production of lithium and other metals needed for battery manufacturing have implemented their restrictions to control virus transmission.\nThe Association of Mining and Exploration Companies in Australia has warned of interstate travel restrictions. In Chile, a national curfew has been imposed and Argentina has a countrywide quarantine. Both countries have significant lithium deposits. In Africa, border and port closures in South Africa and Congo, the largest source for cobalt, will create raw material supply disruptions. The associated risks and travel restrictions will impact the delivery of raw materials and finished goods downstream, which will further add to the market uncertainty.\nOver the last decade, technology advancement and large-scale production have prompted a rapid decline in battery costs. Increased market deployment and improved supply chain efficiencies are key to further accelerating the technology advancement and reducing costs.\nDue to the ongoing pandemic, raw materials supply, logistics,  transportation and labour have witnessed challenges, which would lead to increased production and operating costs for manufacturers. The rise in costs will also impact the financial returns of under-construction projects that were underpinned by a steady decline in battery prices. In addition, the market expansion is likely to slow down due to the current macroeconomic environment and a stall in the decline of prices is expected in the short term.\nThe economic slowdown will affect energy storage adoption along with other renewables deployment. Volatility in the market could defer investors and make it difficult for projects seeking financing.

    "https://www.livemint.com/market/mark-to-market/replacement-market-may-power-battery-sales-after-the-lockdown-11587667058735.html": "Auto replacement sales account for 39-45% of both battery makers’ revenue and 55-70% of operating profitsThe collapse in demand from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) is likely to be offset by an increase in replacement market sales once the lockdown ends\nThe impact of the lockdown may be less harsh on battery makers, in spite of the expected 30-50% drop in domestic vehicle sales. The collapse in demand from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) is likely to be offset by an increase in replacement market sales once the lockdown ends.The upshot: Exide Industries Ltd and Amara Raja Batteries Ltd, which enjoy a duopoly in the organized battery segment, will gain, as auto replacement sales account for 39-45% of their revenue and 55-70% of operating profits.“We envisage some demand surge led by battery discharge. Also, companies have enough inventory (about 20-25 days’ raw material and finished goods) to cater to this immediate spurt in demand,\" said a report by Edelweiss Securities Ltd.Of course, March quarter performance will be weak, with both companies mirroring the impact of the pandemic, lockdown and the transition to BS-VI standards on revenue and profit.However, the Street is already looking beyond the near-term impact. A report by Kotak Institutional Equities said: “Even during the 2008 global crisis, both Amara Raja and Exide Industries gross revenues grew by 17% year-on-year (yoy) in FY09 and 7% yoy in FY10 mainly led by strong auto replacement segment demand.\"Also, profit margin gains could come from the 10% y-o-y dip in lead prices, and 7% since Q3 FY20. Besides, both companies could gain market share from the distressed unorganized segment, as the lockdown eases. The duopoly will also give both firms pricing power, which will buoy gross margins.That said, it would be several quarters before other segments recover. Auto OEMs are expected to see a sales drop until FY21 as they grapple with numerous challenges both on the demand and supply sides. Demand for telecom, industrial batteries and home inverters will also take time to recoup.But with the expected increase in replacement demand, analysts have trimmed the operating margin estimates for FY20-22 by just 50-100 basis points.That said, Exide and Amara Raja stocks have been weighed down by the overall gloom, and have fallen by 21% and 23%, respectively, so far this year.Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.
