    "https://simplywall.st/news/how-many-samsung-sdi-co-ltd-krx006400-shares-do-institutions-own/": " If you want to know who really controls Samsung SDI Co., Ltd. (KRX:006400), then you’ll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.  Samsung SDI is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of ₩19t. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Samsung SDI.  Check out our latest analysis for Samsung SDI  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.  As you can see, institutional investors own 42% of Samsung SDI. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can’t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there’s always a risk that they are in a ‘crowded trade’. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Samsung SDI’s historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there’s always more to the story.  We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Samsung SDI. Our data shows that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. Next, we have National Pension Service and BlackRock, Inc. as the second and third largest shareholders, holding 11% and 3.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.  Additionally, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no one share holder has significant control over the company.  While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock’s expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.  Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.  Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Samsung SDI Co., Ltd.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own ₩2.5b of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.   With a 38% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over A006400. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.  It appears to us that public companies own 21% of A006400. We can’t be certain, but this is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.  It’s always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Samsung SDI better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we’ve spotted with Samsung SDI .  Ultimately the future is most important.
