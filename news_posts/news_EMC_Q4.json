    "https://www.earlycountynews.com/articles/diverse-power-emc-purchases-sgrita/": "Wednesday, April 1, 2020\nBy \n\r\n        ohtadmin    \n| \n on \r\n        March 31, 2020    The News has learned that Diverse Power, an EMC based in LaGrange has purchased the South Georgia Regional Information Technology Authority — SGRITA. Approval for Diverse Power’s purchase and internet plan is pending with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The terms of the pending purchase haven’t been disclosed.The SGRITA board of directors adopted a resolution in August 2017 authorizing the public sale of the broadband system for the purpose of satisfying USDA/RUS Broadband Initiatives Program debt.In 2010, SGRITA was awarded a Broadband Initiatives Program combination loan/grant in the amount of $13,327,030 from the USDA’s Rural Utilities Service Telecommunications Program.SGRITA had been unable to make the USDA/RUS monthly loan payments since August 2016. As of June 2017 $4,771,540.97 of the loan was outstanding.SGRITA and RUS entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in July 2017 stating RUS will agree to accept proceeds from public sale in satisfaction of the outstanding debt.SGRITA began soliciting bids in the third quarter of 2019 for the sale of its assets, including more than 600 customers in Early, Miller, Baker, Calhoun and Mitchell counties. Diverse Power Inc. was the only bidder among 16 eligible contenders to respond to SGRITA’s request for proposal.The purchase was made possible by Senate Bill 2, legislation passed by the 2019 General Assembly, which allows electric membership corporations such as Diverse Power Inc. to provide broadband services.Diverse Power’s internet affiliate Kudzu Networks Inc. will allow the EMC to adhere to requirements outlined in SB 2 ensuring cross-subsidizations do not occur between the electric activities of Diverse Power Inc. and associated broadband activities.Early County and the City of Blakely entered into an agreement in 2015 to manage SGRITA. Both Mayor Anthony Howard and Commission Chair June Merritt told the News at that time that the future of SGRITA hinges on to what extent USDA/RUS officials are willing to forgive the outstanding debt.Merritt reaffirmed at that time the SGRITA Board of Directors’ commitment to existing customers, stating, “SGRITA is committed to continuing to providing quality service to all its customers as this sale to another company occurs.”It appears the purchase of SGRITA by Diverse Power will fulfill that commitment.Diverse Power Inc. is an EMC based in LaGrange that provides energy-related services to approximately 3,300 members in Troup, Harris, Heard, Meriwether, Muscogee, Coweta, Quitman, Randolph, Clay, Calhoun and parts of Early, Stewart and Terrell counties, and Chambers County, Ala.Your email address will not be published.

    "https://siliconangle.com/2020/03/27/as-new-reports-show-tipping-point-dell-emc-addresses-data-protection-gaps-in-the-cloud-cubeconversations/": "\nUPDATED 14:00 EDT / MARCH 27 2020\n\n\n\t                    \t\t                        by \nMark Albertson\n\nWithin the past month, two organizations released reports documenting why having a cloud data protection strategy will be increasingly critical in the near future.The “2020 Thales Data Threat Report,” with analysis by IDC Research Inc., revealed that organizations are reaching a tipping point when it comes to storing and securing data in the cloud. The study found that 50% of all corporate data is now retained in the cloud and nearly half of that is considered sensitive. All of those responding to the Thales survey said that some of the data was not encrypted and half had experienced a breach.To further add to the data security picture, Dell Technologies Inc. recently released its “Global Data Protection Index 2020 Snapshot.” The latest report found that businesses are managing nearly 40% more data than a year ago, with the estimated cost of data loss exceeding $1 million per organization. The snapshot of over 1,000 information-technology decision makers also found that over half of organizations are struggling to find usable data protection solutions that cover edge computing infrastructure and artificial intelligence platforms.“More than half the customers don’t have a data protection solution for their SaaS, cloud native, and multicloud environments,” said Beth Phalen (pictured), president of the Data Protection Division at Dell EMC. “More than two-thirds of the customers who may be relying on their cloud service providers for data protection say that they do not have a solution that covers all of their workloads. Whether they’re working with a cloud service provider or some other vendor, they’re being really clear that they do not have a comprehensive approach to cloud data protection.”Phalen spoke with Dave Vellante, host of theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media’s mobile livestreaming studio, at theCUBE’s studio in Boston, Massachusetts. Rob Emsley, director of product marketing at Dell EMC, also spoke with Vellante in a separate interview. They discussed new tools for container protection, VMware Inc.’s role in supporting Dell EMC’s initiatives, the role of purpose-built appliances, and an overall cloud data protection strategy. (* Disclosure below.)A key element in covering workloads involves comprehensive data protection for container orchestration tools. In February, Dell EMC’s PowerProtect Data Manager platform added support for Kubernetes clusters as a new discoverable asset source.This was followed by the announcement earlier this month that VMware, which is part of the Dell Technologies Inc. family, would include protection support for Kubernetes in the latest vSphere 7 release. The vSphere release included remote attestation that enhanced security through the use of a trusted host to verify the integrity of other hosts within a network.“We’re the first large enterprise data protection vendor to lean in to providing Kubernetes data protection,” Emsley said. “That becomes vitally important especially with the developments over at our partner VMware with vSphere 7 and the introduction of Tanzu. Customers will have both vSphere virtual machines and Kubernetes containers working side by side and both of those environments need to be protected.”Another key element in the evolving data protection landscape involves the use of purpose-built appliances to safely secure enterprise information. EMC set the stage for its role in this market when it outbid NetApp Inc. to purchase Data Domain Inc. for $2.4 billion in 2009.Since then, Dell EMC’s deduplication product line has emerged as the market leader in purpose-built backup arrays, according to IDC. Last year, Dell EMC rebranded Data Domain to PowerProtect as part of its announcement around new products for speed, security, and multicloud data protection.With PowerProtect Data Manager and the X400, Dell EMC’s cloud-enabled scale-out data management appliance, customers are being offered much-needed protection options.“It gives us the ability to offer customers choice: scale up or scale out,” Emsley said. “We’re providing customers with the existing software solutions that we’ve had in the market for a long time with an integrated form factor, as well as the brand-new software platform that will really be our innovation engine.”It’s a safe bet that data protection vendors, such as Dell EMC, will focus more heavily on cloud platforms, with additional announcements to come. Phalen hinted at this in her interview.“Core to our strategy is to be the essential provider of data protection for multicloud environments,” Phalen said. “If you want three words to remember for our strategy, think VMware, cloud and cyber. Cloud is central to it, and you’re going to be hearing more about it in the weeks and months ahead.”Watch the complete video interview below and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE’s and theCUBE’s CUBE Conversations.

Years later, where are they in terms of paying that back, and has the deal paid for itself?When EMC  put itself up for sale, it was under pressure from activist investors Elliott Management to break up the company. In particular, Elliott reportedly wanted the company to sell one of its most valuable parts, VMware, which it believed would help boost EMC’s share price. (Elliott is currently turning the screws on Twitter and SoftBank.)Whatever the reason, once the company went up for sale, Dell and private equity firm Silver Lake came ‘a callin with an offer EMC CEO Joe Tucci  couldn’t refuse. The arrangement represented great returns for his shareholders, and Tucci got to exit on his terms, telling Elliott to take a hike (even if it was Elliott that got the ball rolling in the first place).Dell eventually took itself public again in late 2018, probably to help raise some of the money it needed to pay off its debts. We are more than three years past the point where the Dell-EMC deal closed, so we decided to take a look back and see if Dell was wise to take on such debt or not.Dell votes to buy back VMware tracking stock and go public again",

По заявлению организации, истцы требуют, чтобы они были восстановлены на прежних должностях.«Мы считаем, что решения в отношении Майи Мерквиладзе и Шорены Глонти были приняты с грубым нарушением закона и ставили своей целью ограничение служебных полномочий лиц, ответственных за редакционную независимость», — говорится в заявлении EMC от 30 марта.Кроме того, организация также заявила, что принятие\nпротив истцов решения, которые выразились «в увольнении и изменении позиций руководящих\nлиц Службы новостей, однозначно незаконные и необоснованные» действия, «что подтверждается\nи принятыми в вещателе решениями против других критически настроенных сотрудников».«Напомним, что процессу увольнения Майи Мерквиладзе и Шорены Глонти предшествовал ряд кадровых изменений и практика дисциплинарного преследования, которая продолжается по сей день. Из-за ограничения полномочий и создания тяжелой рабочей среды заместитель директора по вещателя Натиа Зоидзе подала в отставку», — заявляет EMC.В этом же контексте EMC также указывает сначала на приостановление полномочий, а потом и на увольнение бывшей ведущей Телевидения Аджарии Теоны Бакуридзе и переводе корреспондента Службы новостей Теоны Харабадзе из Батуми в Кутаиси.В ЕМС «Civil.ge» сообщили, что организация уже подала иск в суд в связи с приостановлением полномочий Теоне Бакуридзе, а по вопросу ее увольнения с работы намеревается подать иск на этой неделе.Директор Вещателя Аджарии Георгий Кохреидзе уволил начальника Службы новостей Телевидения Аджарии Шорену Глонти 28 февраля. В ее отношении велось дисциплинарное делопроизводство в связи со случаем, который имел место год назад.Ранее до этого в Вещателе Аджарии была упразднена должность заместителя начальника Службы новостей, а Майя Мерквиладзе, которая параллельно с этой должностью также занимала должность главного редактора, была официально отстранена от работы с 26 февраля. Как заявляют в вещателе, ей предложили быть продюсером несуществующего ток-шоу или редактором Службы новостей на Радио. Она приняла предложение и осталась в вещателе.По теме:This post is also available in:\nEnglish (Английский) ქართული (Грузинский)Наша страница готовит новости о Грузии и предоставляет читателям информацию об их контексте с 2001 года.
