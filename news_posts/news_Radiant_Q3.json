    "https://www.threeifbyspace.net/2020/03/review-radiant-season-1-part-2-blu-ray-release/": "In the world of Shonen anime, there are more than enough strong main characters to stand out that many new ones become muted in their shadow. Radiant doesn’t sound all that special when you read about its premise. “The world is overrun with monsters called Nemesis—and a young boy infected by them will stop at nothing to defeat them all!“. Sounds like your typical Shonen anime right? Wrong. Lets dive into what makes Radiant different. First, we will give you some background and a sneak preview.Evil creatures called Nemeses fall from the skies and the only ones who can fight them are Wizards—infected ones who survived a Nemesis’s corruption. Seth, one of these survivors, vows not only to fight the Nemeses, but to find their mythical nest, Radiant, and destroy it!Seth has big goals of defeating Nemeses, but first he must earn the trust of the very villagers he wants to protect—not an easy task when those who use magic are just as feared as the Nemeses they fight. Even worse, Seth can barely control his monstrous powers! It’ll take more than brute strength—although it’ll take that too—to get Seth’s quest out of the boonies and into the big time!The story behind Radiant comes from French creator Tony Valente. So right off the bat, we have a unique style and feel to the series that sets it apart from the rest. It is clear that the creator has a passion for Shonen manga and anime. He paid close attention to the many tropes you see in such series but also tried to break the mold in many ways as well. That is what makes me very excited to see where this series goes.Radiant revolves around a world filled with monsters called Nemeses who are appearing out of nowhere. The only ones who can fight them are wizards. But in this world wizards are feared just as much as the Nemeses. This is because they use magic, and only after they have survived an encounter with a Nemeses which normally kills a person. Besides the magic, those who survive also get an ‘infection’. In the case of Seth, he gained a pair of horns. But what makes Seth unique is his ability to use magic with his bare hands, something considered abnormal even among wizards.The second half of season 1 explores Discrimination and hatred set in Rumble Town. With Rumble Town ablaze and Seth’s battle shaking up the world, the Inquisition is questioned, as are the intentions of the Nemesis. A stranger with two white horns asks Seth—whose side is he on?The formula for the story is pretty familiar with all the magic-related series of late. Our lead character is also predictable: bold, hard-headed, big dreams and no discipline. I enjoyed the art style of the characters and world-building. They managed to give us a decent amount without overwhelming.  The little details with each character and background are fun to look at and analyze their meaning.Whether Seth ever finds the mythical origin land of the Nemeses, Radiant, or not, I will be going along for the journey.The limited-edition release of the second half of season 1 for Radiant includes a chipboard box that houses both parts of season 1. The box cover has the title character, Seth, on one side with the Radiant logo. The other side shows the Inquisition in the background with Seth and an unknown character standing back to back.The set includes 13 episodes on 2 blu-ray discs and 2 DVDs. You also get a digital copy that you can download. As part of the limited-edition release, you also get an 80-page hardcover art book, 2 keychains and a set of art cards.Founder and managing editor for Three If By Space.

    "https://www.thecinemaholic.com/anime-like-radiant/": "Adapted from Tony Valente’s French Manfra of the same name, ‘Radiant’ has a massive cast of well-developed characters, a meticulously devised world, and incredible production. Although it had a rough start when its first season premiered back in 2018, with its second season, ‘Radiant’ has now shunned all the hate surrounding it with the depth of its storyline. But for all its hype and worth, ‘Radiant’ is still not unique and has a lot of similarities with other shounen out there. So here’s a list of all the anime that you might enjoy watching if you like ‘Radiant‘. Most of the anime mentioned in the list below are available on Funimation, Crunchyroll or Hulu.\nJust like ‘Radiant’, ‘UQ Holder’ is set in a world where the whole idea of magic is new to most people and that’s the reason why they look at it with skepticism. Unlike Radiant, the main character of ‘UQ Holder’ is not considered to be an outcast just because of his magical abilities but he, too, struggles to make a name for himself in a world where his uncanny powers make him a minority. Also, ‘UQ Holder’ is a very loyal adaptation of its source manga whereas ‘Radiant’ often makes changes to the original storyline.‘The Legend of the Legendary Heroes’ revolves around a lazy mage named Ryner Lute who possesses the Alpha Stigma, a mark on his forehead which takes control over his body and forces him to do things he doesn’t want to do. Because of this uncontrollable ability, he often ends up killing anyone he gets close to. But later, he joins forces with a swordswoman and a king to finally put his ability to good use and bring peace in the world he lives in.For the most part, ‘The Legend of the Legendary Heroes’ is less of a shounen and more of a fantasy anime show. However, it does share a lot of world-building elements and shounen tropes with ‘Radiant’. Even the magic system of the two anime is quite similar. Moreover, the protagonists of both the anime are initially feared because of their unique magic abilities but when they put these abilities to good use, they get the respect they deserve.Asta and Yuno are two young boys who were abandoned at the Church. After growing up together, both of them started sharing the common dream of becoming the demon king someday. As they grew up, Yuno started to show some promising magic skills while Asta tried his best to show off but never really managed to outshine Yuno. Because of his skills, Yuno ends up getting a Grimoire with a four-leaf clover while Asta gets nothing at all. However, one day, when Yuno gets attacked by a former magic knight, everything changes. Just to save his friend from the Knight, Asta ends up unleashing all of his magical abilities and with this, he and Yuno embark on an adventure to fulfill their dream of becoming the greatest mage of their village.Unlike ‘Radiant’, where magic practitioners are often looked upon, magic is more of a necessity in the world of ‘Black Clover.’ But because of that, just like Seth, even Asta and Yuno turn out to be misfits among their people. Both the shows also follow a very typical shounen-styled storyline which can get a little predictable at times,  but their main appeal lies in their epic battle scenes. From a character development standpoint, ‘Black Clover’ has more depth but Radiant’s comedy is far more enjoyable.In the world of ‘Blue Exorcist’, humans and demons don’t get along too well and exist in two different realms. The only way demons can exist in the human realm is by possessing humans on the other side. Satan, who is the ruler of the demon realm, fails to find a suitable host and is forced to stay trapped in his own realm. That’s when he gets an idea. Instead of going to the human realm himself, he sends his own son there and hopes that he’ll grow up to fulfill his dream of ruling humans.Rin Okumura is the demon’s son who initially lives a fairly ordinary life in the human world until one day, he is ambushed by several demons and is told what is expected from him. However, he chooses to defy his father and instead of conquering the human world, he vows to become an exorcist and protect it from evil forces. Just like Seth from ‘Radiant’, Rin seems to be somewhat of a troublesome teenager but he later proves that there’s a lot more to him than just that. The protagonists of both the shows are initially distrusted by the ones who surround them because of how different they are. But much later, they’re both able to prove that they only intend to protect humans from dark forces.Read More: Radiant Season 3© 2020 Cinemaholic Inc. All rights reserved.

Additional minimum availability requirements and financial covenants apply in the event the Company seeks to use advances under the Secured Facility to pursue acquisitions or repurchase its common stock.

In addition, with the benefit of our new financing arrangements, we enjoy additional capacity to continue to execute on additional compelling acquisition opportunities while also preserving our ability to pursue other initiatives to unlock shareholder value, including opportunities to buyback of our common stock.\"Crain continued: \"The COVID-19 virus is likely to continue to create a lot of stress on supply chains and the financial markets well into 2020. We are fortunate to have de-levered our business with proceeds from an equity raise back in 2015, and unlike many of our peers, we have continued to use our free cash flow to pay-down debt and strengthen our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2019 our consolidated leverage ratio was at a very conservative 1.0x.  Our new facility gives us the financial flexibility to successfully navigate these markets while providing the financial stability to confidently support our operating partners and the end customers that we serve.  We also believe that as customers consider the underlying financial health of their current supply chain partners, Radiant may represent an attrative alternative.\"About Radiant Logistics, Inc.Radiant Logistics, Inc.
