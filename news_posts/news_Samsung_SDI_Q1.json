    "https://simplywall.st/news/how-many-samsung-sdi-co-ltd-krx006400-shares-do-institutions-own/": " If you want to know who really controls Samsung SDI Co., Ltd. (KRX:006400), then you’ll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership.  Samsung SDI is a pretty big company. It has a market capitalization of ₩19t. Normally institutions would own a significant portion of a company this size. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. Let’s delve deeper into each type of owner, to discover more about Samsung SDI.  Check out our latest analysis for Samsung SDI  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.  As you can see, institutional investors own 42% of Samsung SDI. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can’t rely on that fact alone, since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there’s always a risk that they are in a ‘crowded trade’. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Samsung SDI’s historic earnings and revenue, below, but keep in mind there’s always more to the story.  We note that hedge funds don’t have a meaningful investment in Samsung SDI. Our data shows that Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. Next, we have National Pension Service and BlackRock, Inc. as the second and third largest shareholders, holding 11% and 3.5%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.  Additionally, we found that the top 13 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no one share holder has significant control over the company.  While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock’s expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.  The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.  Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.  Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Samsung SDI Co., Ltd.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own ₩2.5b of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling.   With a 38% ownership, the general public have some degree of sway over A006400. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.  It appears to us that public companies own 21% of A006400. We can’t be certain, but this is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.  It’s always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Samsung SDI better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we’ve spotted with Samsung SDI .  Ultimately the future is most important.

    "https://simplywall.st/news/how-does-samsung-sdis-krx006400-p-e-compare-to-its-industry-after-the-share-price-drop/": " To the annoyance of some shareholders, Samsung SDI (KRX:006400) shares are down a considerable 34% in the last month. Indeed, the recent drop has reduced the annual gain to a relatively sedate 6.5% over the last twelve months.  Assuming nothing else has changed, a lower share price makes a stock more attractive to potential buyers. In the long term, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, but in the short term prices bounce around in response to short term factors (which are not always obvious). The implication here is that long term investors have an opportunity when expectations of a company are too low. Perhaps the simplest way to get a read on investors’ expectations of a business is to look at its Price to Earnings Ratio (PE Ratio). A high P/E implies that investors have high expectations of what a company can achieve compared to a company with a low P/E ratio.  See our latest analysis for Samsung SDI  Samsung SDI’s P/E of 41.55 indicates some degree of optimism towards the stock. As you can see below, Samsung SDI has a much higher P/E than the average company (9.4) in the electronic industry.  Its relatively high P/E ratio indicates that Samsung SDI shareholders think it will perform better than other companies in its industry classification. Shareholders are clearly optimistic, but the future is always uncertain. So further research is always essential. I often monitor director buying and selling.  Probably the most important factor in determining what P/E a company trades on is the earnings growth. If earnings are growing quickly, then the ‘E’ in the equation will increase faster than it would otherwise. Therefore, even if you pay a high multiple of earnings now, that multiple will become lower in the future. Then, a lower P/E should attract more buyers, pushing the share price up.  Samsung SDI’s earnings per share fell by 49% in the last twelve months. But over the longer term (5 years) earnings per share have increased by 15%.  Don’t forget that the P/E ratio considers market capitalization. In other words, it does not consider any debt or cash that the company may have on the balance sheet. The exact same company would hypothetically deserve a higher P/E ratio if it had a strong balance sheet, than if it had a weak one with lots of debt, because a cashed up company can spend on growth.  Spending on growth might be good or bad a few years later, but the point is that the P/E ratio does not account for the option (or lack thereof).  Net debt totals 16% of Samsung SDI’s market cap. It would probably deserve a higher P/E ratio if it was net cash, since it would have more options for growth.  Samsung SDI’s P/E is 41.6 which is way above average (10.9) in its market. With modest debt but no EPS growth in the last year, it’s fair to say the P/E implies some optimism about future earnings, from the market. What can be absolutely certain is that the market has become significantly less optimistic about Samsung SDI over the last month, with the P/E ratio falling from 63.4 back then to 41.6 today. For those who don’t like to trade against momentum, that could be a warning sign, but a contrarian investor might want to take a closer look.  When the market is wrong about a stock, it gives savvy investors an opportunity. As value investor Benjamin Graham famously said, ‘In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine. So this free visual report on analyst forecasts could hold the key to an excellent investment decision.  Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates. So take a peek at this free list of companies with modest (or no) debt, trading on a P/E below 20.
